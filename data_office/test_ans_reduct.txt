hi belle ! this is a laser copier .
i have 2 spare rolls of the labels and on the brother packaging it 's states 12mm x 8m which equates to about 25feethope that answers your queryregards
yes , you can center and seal item inside of plastic cover then trim with a sharp blade or scissors .
no they are not .
i do n't know the actual thickness -- but it works fine in my several-year-old printer which uses ordinary standard printing paper .
yes , i have that model and it works with mine .
i just hit the total ( * ) button a second time and it clears the registers
as i recall , this machine was a piece of c**p. it did not last long at all and it was n't cheap . i now have a sharp , which seems to be holding up pretty well . good luck !
it is 7.0 '' long x 3.5 '' wide x 1.5 '' thick . no you have to have a wire holder for it to hold .
troy , i looked on the box , and could not find an expiration date at all !
it 's a great fax machine , but it is not a network scanner . you are better off with an `` all-in-one '' copier , scanner , printer & fax if that is your requirement . you can find some very good ones in the same price range from hp and dell .

it has openings for screws but no hooks screws . you could use command hooks or cup hooks . i think push pins wo n't be strong enough .
yes , it will ! i 'm really happy with this product . it is a lot better built , sturdier and heavier , than other paper cutters i 've had .
sure . the template is just a word document . just make sure the first time that except for the 10 , the remainder of the document is blank .
no , they are not .
12 ' ( height ) x 12 '' ( width ) x 9 '' ( deep )
it 's about 27 inches . but you can adjust it easily to make it longer or shorter . i like this one a lot . i would order again .
ca n't tell you exactly . my postal scale ( which is the only scale i have in my office ) only goes up to five pounds . the 24 lb . version of this paper weighs more than five pound ( 500 sheet box ) . i would estimate the weight at seven or eight pounds .
yes , any universal kit will work . this board comes with its own mounting kit .
i believe it will .
50
i have not tried that . sorry i ca n't help !
no , mine came without a clip . as for the gift box , it is just a basic and simple plastic box , not at all fancy . i would not put a wedding ring in such a box .
the short answer is no . the foot of the stand is two tubes that are as wide ( one leg of mine is a bit wider ) than the top . so if stacked , it would be very unstable and i am sure you would have it fall off one side or the other eventually . what you could do is place two small boards or a piece of plywood or rods or whatever as a platform across the top . would not look good . actually that is a great question and when i looked at it its too bad because if it would work , i would get another one myself . but aside from the adding a platform of some sort , would not work .
i did not find this product easy to work with . did n't have a problem with bleeding or yellowing ; however you can forget the repositioning and it 's messy as all get out being a spray . i did not find it user friendly for small things . much more adapted to big surfaces where it does n't matter if the spray hits areas other than where you want to seal something . i wo n't be purchasing this product again .
no there is n't a secondary battery back up . however there are 4 aa batteries that saves the memory .
yes on the bottom of the phone itself it has a switch for hi and low volume and a switch for on and off and pulse and rotary . the cord from the phone to the receiver is permanent ( can not be took out ) but the phone jack cord can be as long as you like it to be..
i tried and it would n't work .
yes , as pictured
it adjusts to 3 height settings .
the width of the stand is 19 '' and the depth from front to back is 14 '' . the height is 4 '' and the space under the drawer is 2 1 4 '' .i have two of them . one at work and one at home . in my option a good monitor stand .
yes , should be able to . just make sure all the cartridge slots at least have the empty ones in them , and run the scan via the software on your computer . not via the buttons on the face of printer .
we have had photos in them for over 25 years and all is still like new ... ... .
i imagine the forms they will be sending are for the current tax year . you may want to send a message directly to the company if you 're not certain .
1 4 inch is the recomended lenght of the leg of the staple . i use max staples with it , it is a standard staple . all of my desktop staplers uses this size , i use different colors . 26 6 using milimeters the 6mm being the leg of the staple .
it 's like a normal pencil but without the wood . this also depends on the hard softness of the lead .
i do n't know the paper weight but i will say they are well made of excellent quality material . i have used nearly half of my original order & will reorder soon . have n't had any complaints from my mail recipients .
have you tried avery 5390 ? it takes a little dexterity and patience to slide it into the badge holder without wrinkling , but size fits well .
paper not in correctly
given that i am very short & most chairs are made for taller people , this device has saved my life . therefore , if it slips a little and occasionally makes noise while doing so , so be it . i bring it everywhere , so i 've used it on wood , tile , concrete & carpets . obviously , it wo n't slide on a carpet , but , oh well ... .
i do n't know ..but this one did n't work in my pixmaip6222od as it said it would

hello and good day . the 3210 was a capable printer . when it worked . for i did had soft ware issues , i had to delete everything an reinstall . but for me was the feed mechanism . over an over an over , paper jams . so got tired an got epson 837. an epson way out performed hp ... . just the issue is inks are expensive .
measured and they are exactly as stated .
unlined . and they are great !
no this is not wireless printer so you ca n't print from your phone regards
bill , yes you can . that 's the main reason i use mine . be advised , with more weight in the portafile , the front latch will not hold . it is weak .
andrew , the imageclass mf3240 does not have wi-fi compatibility nor can it be used on linux .
hi dennis , i have n't tried this myself , but i would guess that this device would struggle to accurately record equations : it will probably mistake greek characters mathematical characters for more common letters , although you may be able to select mathematical formula as the ocr language .
they are not thick . the texture would show .
i have the obusforme unltraforme back rest , and with it i use the matching obusforme 3 piece seat cushion . works for me . good luck .
i do n't know if it shreds them , but i leave both staples and paper clips on the paper and it handles it with not problem .
vertical i was very disappointed because i wanted horizontal .
it cuts my chip board just fine . however , keep in mind that chip board comes in different weights and i ca n't speak for heavier weights .
i do not think it will work for that application . however i am not sure , i only use this with paper .
it takes me about a minute per slide . while i am scanning one batch , i tweak the previous batch in another program so the project keeps moving along . i 've had the canoscan for 2 months now , have scanned about 100 slides without any problems . i am very happy with it . i have a little tutorial on my site that shows some of my results : http : www.patriciaweppler.com tutorial.htm
these have the quickstrip closure - simply remove the strip and fold the flap to adhere it .

there is an opening in the back with a rack like fixture . dimensions about 1 x 4 inches ( height x width ) and throughout the bottom there is about half inch clearance .
for me , it does n't go under completely
the model number is ad-24 . it is a 14.4 watt switching adapter at 9 volts giving 1.6 amps . the plug uses positive outer conductor and is roughly 0.5 cm outer diameter and 3 mm inner . i think it 's fairly common adapter you may have around the house .
no
assuming that you meant ringer equivalence number ( ren ) , i have no idea what that means . maybe if you could be more specific , i could answer the question .
it works for sure with the bases specified in the amazon display . i do n't know whether it works the same for the many other panasonic bases not specified in the amazon display .
wall mounts ; not obtrusive ; is fine ...
from the manual : headset ( optional ) connecting a headset to the handsetallows hands-free phoneconversations . we recommend usingthe panasonic headset noted on page5 .
it was horrible and thrown away writhing weeks of purchase ! do not buy !
no , although mine came with a blank tile ... but only one . but you can make your own . i went to my local craft store and bought some magnetic tape . you can cut it any size you want to and it has an adhesive side . my son and i have a lot of fun finding small pictures in magazines ... or even on the computer . i cut them out , give it a coat of clear nail polish and stick a piece of magnetic tape on the back . for instance , if he has a play date , i 'll take a picture of his friend , reduce the playmate 's head shot on photoshop and make a magnet for the calendar . he loves seeing who 's house we are actually going to . no , although mine came with a blank tile ... but only one . but you can make your own . i went to my local craft store and bought some magnetic tape . you can cut it any size you want to and it has an adhesive side . my son and i have a lot of fun finding small pictures in magazines ... or even on the computer . i cut them out , give it a coat of clear nail polish and stick a piece of magnetic tape on the back . for instance , if he has a play date , i 'll take a picture of his friend , reduce the playmate 's head shot on photoshop and make a magnet for the calendar . he loves seeing who 's house we are ... » read more no , although mine came with a blank tile ... but only one . but you can make your own . i went to my local craft store and bought some magnetic tape . you can cut it any size you want to and it has an adhesive side . my son and i have a lot of fun finding small pictures in magazines ... or even on the computer . i cut them out , give it a coat of clear nail polish and stick a piece of magnetic tape on the back . for instance , if he has a play date , i 'll take a picture of his friend , reduce the playmate 's head shot on photoshop and make a magnet for the calendar . he loves seeing who 's house we are actually going to . « show less
i did not know the ink cartridges have an expiration date .
i have not . not sure how it could be done even if i wanted to .
judging from the images they are the same . one website lists the 016 as the `` standard color '' while the 026 is the black color
no . ink cost more than machine , and postage to return did too so i trashed it .
not as far as i 'm aware . it connects via a usb cable .
call the company that makes the product , they sell replacement wheels . they actually gave me 1 or 2 for free the 1st time i called . i had to purchase a set of 5 last time .
16 '' from floor to bottom of the seat cushion .
if it gets too hot or you have done too many lamination 's , it will not allow you to do another lamination . full turn off , i am not sure as when i am complete with what i need to do i physically turn it off and unplug it .
yes , we offer a template for these on our website . it is downloadable for free and works with microsoft word . it can be found under the templates section under the heading labels . if amazon allows this , here is a link to the templates page on our website - http : www.desktopsupplies.com templates.html

the photo is really small , so i am guessing ... no it does n't look like it has ink in it .
you will have to bend down a bit ... .the top of the board is at 66 '' when on the wheels .
stays on .
for my classroom purposes , it 's fine . my warnings , however , are that the board may be too high up for a three year old . also , the surface of the board is a bit delicate . get water , juice , even the oils from your fingers on it , and you will have problems getting it completely clean . i guess my answer is `` look elsewhere '' .
screw not adhesive . i have four of these in my home . work great !
no . it is a date stamp . you ca n't make it say whatever you want .
yes !
you can print on both sides of the card . you just need a printer that can do double sided printing or work out how to turn the card over and get the printing aligned . a couple of trial runs should fix that problemregardsalex
as far as i know all canon pp-201 paper has the same weight .
i got this for my wife to carry her ipad and a lined notepad for meetings at work . i 'm not sure how thick the mac book is but i would think it would fit . there is a lot of room inside it . plenty of room for the ipad and the note pad , plus a calculator and pens and pencils . hope this helps .
yes , it is a genuine hp . i 've tried the `` clones '' without success , but this one was a genuine hp .
expiration is september 2015 - i will have this one used by march now that it 's tax time .
the refill is the standard cross refill medium point black # 0405
all my pilot pens seem standard so you can try it .
yes you can use either one for the lexmark higher resolution with the 16 26. but i do n't really see a difference
includes everything but the current year calendar refill of your choice .
i have not had a problem with the call waiting . it is a separate function from the phone company that i purchased to allow the number to be shown .
it does n't come with casters , and it s not optional . only like picture indicates . it is very nice looking table after it 's assembled .
i do n't see why not . the barrel is certainly large enough .
i just tried taking out the cartridge to print a photo and the printer does n't appear to work without a cartridge in the slot . so i do n't think it will work without the cartridge .
it is only 15 '' across between the 2 sides and about 10.5 '' deep , it wo n't fit a 17.3 '' laptop : (
the 3x4 fit
yes
yes it can i have a pavilion g6 and it 's perfect . my screens size is 15.6 and it 's great i like it because i can adjust the height i also like it because it has a built-in mouse pad .
yes - holds a full strip of staples and yes , they are standard size .
i do not know . i have always used canon printers , ink and paper . read on the back of the canon paper and see if it is compatible to the hp printer . or ask the associates at best buy or staples for their opinion .
there are no arms . low for seat is higher than a standard office chair by 4-5 inches . it comes with an extension bar and goes pretty high .
you need to know your network name ( ssid ) and network password before setting up your product on your wireless network ( see wireless security settings for more information ) . if you do n't know your network name ( ssid ) and network password , contact the person who set up your network . then see the wireless network installation section in the network installation guide for instructions . http : www.youtube.com watch ? v=apyfj5aj0-m
the keyboard trays that screw on are the best . the very first time i installed this tray it worked great . i had to move it ( that 's why i did n't want the screw on keyboard ) . since i 've moved it the tray becomes loose and i ca n't tighten it completely . the nuts are plastic and i will have to replace them - that might solve my problem . for the money it is a good product . i do n't feel this tray was intended for heavy use like a work environment .

hi scott . the pen comes with a converter . to fill it , you submerge the nib into an ink bottle and twist the knob on the top of the converter . the pen is also cartridge compatible if you 'd rather use cartridges instead . i like bottle ink because there are so many more choices available .
no
i purchased 100 12x15.5 and that 's what i got !
yes and yes !
this is designed for larger 12x18 '' paper . so yes , your 12x12 paper will technically fit but the slots are way bigger than you need ( slots will be too deep ) . i would suggest getting a smaller organizer that is designed for 12x12 paper .
i 'm using it with 8.1 and it works fine .
it should work with any kind of cartridge . in general you make an hole in the original cartridge through which you push the ink via siringe .
yes and it works well
yes . quite impressive . just do n't push it too hard .
yes it will work in uk .
yes there were 6 colors and the colors shown . maybe the orange is slightly different .

hi ! retail packaging is the kind of packaging you are going to find if you go into a store and buy a product . when someone on-line says `` retail packaging , '' you can be quite sure it 's the real deal and not some knock-off product posing as the real deal . buying ink on-line can be a tricky business because so many vendors deal in third party manufactures -- people who make the ink to fit certain printers . if they say `` retail packaging '' and show you a picture , you can be quite sure it 's what is sold in the stores .

i am sorry i am not familiar with such joystick , however the mouse pads area is not sturdy at all , in fact one of mine broke after a few months and they made me pay for a replacement .
i think they would work , but when our office moved , we switched to another type of sign holder and i have n't found one of these to try out .
no we had another model that did that , and i totally miss that feature . also display font is small , so it 's hard to read `` new voice mail '' . but sound quality is pretty good .
it is not detachable , it only collapses when the whole thing is folded up .
the embossing plates are plastic . i do n't think they would work on paper plates . sorry .
yes , it has worked well for me . i have been using this chip in a refilled cartridge for over a month . i use it every day . it prints like the new samsung cartridge that i bought for $ 60.00+ . it just takes a few minutes to empty , refill , change chip and reinstall in printer . good luck . j.m .

hi , it has a little beep . it also has a light . i do n't pay that much attention to the workings of it , but i know if i 've been out all day and i come home and there 's a message there will be a quite , intermittent beep . if i check the caller ids without checking the messages , that beep changes to a small blue flashing led.i 'm pretty happy with these phones.hope i 've helped . happy holidays !
yes , the directory you mentioned is very easy to access . there is a little picture of an address book on the screen , you click on the button underneath it and that gives you the list of names you entered in the directory . there are arrows on the big round button on the top of the phone and you can scroll the list , up and down , with it . when the name you want appears on the screen , you click on `` talk . '' you can not add more than one number for each contact , but you can list that contact once for each number .
uses a spiral insert . btw - very sturdy , yet light weight
this is a great pencil sharpener for the price . i even let the kids use it ( which normally i do n't because they break things ! ) sound wise it is n't a tiny `` hum '' , but it is n't super loud either . typical pencil sharpener noise , i 'd say . sorry if that does n't answer your question . a pencil sharpener in a school is an important thing . they usually break or sharpen unevenly . had this for 6 months and it 's going great !

it does not lock .
like most other calculators of this type , it comes with a plastic cover for the front of the calculator that protects the keyboard and screen . there is no `` case , '' as in something that holds the entire calculator .

first , the tape sticks well . i have never had one fall off or even peel back at the edges in the two or three years i have been using them . as long as you apply them properly , i do n't see any reason for concern . as far as residue is concerned , i have only had to remove a few over the past several months and do n't remember any of them having any residue other than a dirt line around the edge ! they peel off quite easily .

you do n't have to plug the hole with a custom plug . you can use duck tape or various layers of electrical tape to cover the hole . but if you 're committed to creating a custom plug , the diameter of the hole made by the tool is 17.39 mm or about 11 16 '' .
yes , that 's the way i have mine setup . and i feed labels and envelopes through the manual tray . it knows what size paper is in each tray and automatically does it 's thing.great printer ! there 's even a wireless app for your tablet or phone . scan and copy work well also .
no , they are thin paper copies
yes it will . at the vpedal website , there is a plugin that you would download , and then from that plugin you would assign whatever the keyboard shortcuts are for : play , pause , fast forward , rewind , etc. , and those keyboard shortcuts then transfer to the foot pedal . i can also use this foot pedal with other forms of transcription software such as express scribe ( free ) , olympus transcription software , itunes , and quicktime player 7. i hope this information is helpful .

sorry , i ca n't answer that . we 're out of the country for the next three months so i ca n't measure it for you .
yes , the base unit .
no , and that was the biggest disappointment
the ones ordered do come with numbers
i have an hp 1212nf mfp printer , fax , copier , and i use the st-ce 285a cartridge , and i have had no problems . the cartridge just slides in and worked great .
the wooden tray is 19 '' wide and about 14 '' deep . so , i would think so .
i am using my dymo with macbook air with i7 processor , which is a 64 bits processor . my dymo cardscan is both mac and windows compatible . my recommendation is that you do verify with www.dymo.com just to make sure .
yes it does ! its a decent product for the price . my wife uses it on a daily basis and has not complained ...
you should be good to go
just one . i wish i had bought several .
yes it did include the chip . the chip seems to work fine .
no , but it does have triangle style hooks on the ends so you can hang it vertical or horizontal .
i only show one photo , & that 's the one i purchesed . absolutely love it . clears up a lot of space in my desk .
it uses aaa batteries , i 'm not sure if you can find rechagable batteries that can be used instead of the aaa batteries .
yes the notepad can be removed . i have replaced it several times . the calculator can be removed with a little effort . it is only held in place by the edges . no glue or anything is used . side note , i have had this for a year and use it 5 days a week for work , it has held up well . it looks as good as it did when i got it . the loop the holds the strap in place shows some wear , but that 's all .
it does n't really cool as far as i can tell , it just keeps the heat off your lap .
yes this phone is cordless it works great my mom is hard of hearing and it amplifies enough so she can hear good when talking
no , i assume because so many devices use usb a-b cables , manufacturers typically assume you already have one . you can buy one from amazon ( http : www.amazon.com startech-6-feet-usb-certified-cable dp b000067spp ref=sr_1_2 ? ie=utf8 &qid; =1352588507 &sr; =8-2 &keywords; =usb+a-b+cable ) for as little as $ 7 including shipping or even less if bundled with another order . local suppliers may even beat this price but places like office supply stores or best buy will likely only stock `` name brand '' stuff costing a lot more ( and which i assure you perform no better ) .
no , i did n't receive the guarantee certificate .
it does not scan , but it does duplex printing both sides in color and black .
yes colored pencils write easily on these labels . they are non-shiny , with a flat finish ( like paper ) and they work well with printer ink , pencil , pen , etc . very versatile labels ... ..and they look great .
yes
yes it does .
it is very easy and quick . telescope legs with clamps , so much faster and less frustrating than the old style .

i 'm sorry i do n't know the answer to that question , but i would think that it would be , its a new printer , so it should be
i do n't know . but i have an imac and it does somehow connect wirelessly . for a cheap printer it is fine , though the original toner cartridge did n't last very long at all
my key card and id are both 2 1 8 '' x 3 3 8 '' and fit perfectly . i just measured and it will fit up to 2 3 8 '' maximum . if this wo n't work maybe the side opening holders would be an option for the larger cards ?
i do n't have any information from the manufacturer , but i was stepping on them ( 115lbs ) and they seemed to hold up just fine .
not that i know of , but i thought i was buying the brand , not an off-market , so i 'm not even sure the brand name cartridges are still the same . i do n't know whether to blame amazon or samsung for this snafu , but somebody better clean up their act .
i 've used the printer for printing legal sized documents quite a bit , and it works just fine . the printer does not have a duplexer , however . manually turning the pages is necessary to print on both sides of a sheet .
it is completely blank , no embossing : )
yes you can
the ink cartridge itself is 2 '' l x 1.75 h ( by tallest part ) x 1.25 w ( by widest part )
yes , but it is only about as wide a paperback . i use it for receipts and it does fine .
13 1 8 `` w x 9 3 4 '' d x 2 3 4 '' h without legs that plug in when assembled . bottom unit is 3 3 8 `` h , same w & d measurements . 2 drawer unit is 6 `` h , same w & d measurements . hope this helps .
no ; you are limited to 8 1 2 '' paper b
mine does the same thing , usually in the middle of printing a photo or multiple pages . i emailed seller for a replacement chip circuitry cartridges . they replied saying to press the reset button ( which i 've done countless times ) , then they said it was out of warranty and they do n't sell just the circuitry . you have to buy the whole kit .
i 'm sorry mary , but the franklin is so difficult to use and the instructions are so poorly written that i 've put it in my desk , ( after trying to use it for three days ) and have never used it . i 'm not a dope ( stanford '61 ) but i feel you should save your money . michael
no no no quick book is a expensive software that you have to upgrade every year . sorry
yes it will work . just as long as they use not so many different types of paper . make sure they set the default to blacke and white only when printing if they do not need color .
yes
i do not believe that it is as i had ordered a usb cord as well and i sent this as a gift .
16 1 2 '' across10 '' front to back
no , i have n't had that problem in two orders .
once you select print , the print window opens , select preferences , then click paper quality , then click advanced options icon that is on the bottom right , under printer features click output quality and select fast draft . hope this helps .
yes by default . the setup disc provides the option
no
yes , hp & epson are generally both built that way , not sure about other brands . not sure about the capacity , will see if i can dig out that info .
you have to play with them as you install ... pull the premounted rails out , make sure you are setting the drawer rails level , and sliding past the plastic lockers ... .then it 's in when you can push them all the way back .
no
it 's 11.5 inches at the tallest point .
that would depend on the size of the checkbook . i would n't hesitate to shred the check registers that i use , but the `` checkbook '' you are referring to may be different from a check register .
good question ; according to the cable service wow , it is and it is not their problem . it is the phone .
i am 6-2 '' 195lbs and this is the chair i use . it fits great and i have my feet up all the time !
robert , i have this printer . actually suzanne is correct , this is not the `` wireless '' version . bud is basically correct too but his terminology is a bit confusing . i will clarify.regarding your first question , the m401dn is a laser printer only , not a multifunction device . it is not a scanner or copier or fax , and does not have glass or a paper feeder . you would need a separate scanner to make copes.regarding network capabilities : first , this is not the wireless model . the wireless version is model m401dw . this is a network printer so yes you can print over a wireless network with it . that 's what suzanne was referring to when she said it is ethernet but not wireless . `` wireless printer '' specifically means the printer communicates with a wifi network without requiring a cable . this printer does require a cable , either an ethernet cable or a usb cable . once connected by cable , the printer can be networked or shared with other computers over a wired or a wireless network . that is not the same as a `` wireless printer '' though , because wireless printers have a built-in wifi adapter , and this printer does not . the advantage of a wireless printer is that you can locate it anywhere within range of your wifi network , it does n't have to be tethered to the router . the other advantage is one less cable so less clutter.to answer your question about a network card , it does n't have one because it does n't need one . it has an ethernet port so it connects to your router directly by ethernet cable and will show up as a network printer on any of the computers connected to your network . not sure what you mean by `` network card '' but the network capability is built-in , it has an ethernet port . it does not include a wireless network card if that 's what you 're asking . you still have to run an ethernet cable . if you want one with a built-in wireless network adapter , you need to get the m401dw.you can also connect it to any computer

the light ( when it works ) is a bluish-purple , but it works because it emits ultraviolet light . pure uv is invisible to the naked eye .
it would be the base station that has the answer and transmitter components in it .
no . it is not possible and they have no intention of doing so .
no , it did n't have a glossy side ... .. great weight for packing though .
the boxes i received did not include partitions . -- kmvictorian
yes it does ... it does n't always get the name right , especially bogus 800 numbers or people selling you `` siding '' but it does announce what it has as information on the number thats calling you ... kinda cool ... allows you to let it go to vmail if you dont like to answer it ... oh ... only announces from the base ... the handsets show the number and information , handsets dont announce out loud ... i hope this clarifies your question ...
hi yes the new machine will come with everything but the printer cable you might need in some situations in setting it up . however the first set of ink is like 1 4 the fill of standard ink cartridges i do suggest you consider getting your refills right away . that being said the main reason i personally chose brother is that it will accept generic filled ink cartridges without all this special bar code stuff other machines do to insure you only are using their brand . so go ahead and buy generic works great for me .
this decidedly ac with a 6-7-foot cord . other inquirers have asked about the on off toggle switch which is located at the lower right ( facing front ) back of the machine . the only jams i have encountered are when things like buttons , tokens , half dollars , dollar coins , foreign coins ( even canadian ) and bent pennies have slipped in in bags of coins . yesterday i sorted and `` rolled '' $ 89 in less than 1 2 hour . this sorter beats any of the others i 've used - either battery or ac .
i have owned mfc8910dw for 3 months now and am very pleased with the scanning performance . the scanning is very quick , and the feeder works great for multiple pages , either for one side or dual side . the scan rate slows down if you want higher resolution or color , but for my general purpose application where text is of interest , the rate is very quick ( dont remember the dpi , 150x150 i think ) . the iphone app works very well too , the only complaint i have is that the app does not have option for dual page . the wireless works flawlessly as well.in general , i am very happy with this printer . i have owned mfc8910dw for 3 months now and am very pleased with the scanning performance . the scanning is very quick , and the feeder works great for multiple pages , either for one side or dual side . the scan rate slows down if you want higher resolution or color , but for my general purpose application where text is of interest , the rate is very quick ( dont remember the dpi , 150x150 i think ) . the iphone app works very well too , the only complaint i have is that the app does not have option for dual page . the wireless works flawlessly as well.in general , i am very happy with this ... » read more i have owned mfc8910dw for 3 months now and am very pleased with the scanning performance . the scanning is very quick , and the feeder works great for multiple pages , either for one side or dual side . the scan rate slows down if you want higher resolution or color , but for my general purpose application where text is of interest , the rate is very quick ( dont remember the dpi , 150x150 i think ) . the iphone app works very well too , the only complaint i have is that the app does not have option for dual page . the wireless works flawlessly as well.in general , i am very happy with this printer . « show less

i have had no problems on putting pressure on the glass . the scanner worked properly . i returned the a3 1200s scanner ( doa ) & purchased the a3 2400s - a little more expensive , so my observations are for the a3 2400s model . it should be ok though - same design.the only other observation i can make is that the objects must be flat - the depth of field for these type scanners , as opposed to the ccd type devices , which are at least three times as expensive , is nonexistent . but for flat objects it 's just fine - and fast .
i did n't even check to see where the pen was made but i use my pens every day and one of the pens does not meet the quality that i have come to expect from cross . the click on one pen has raised above the normal position to the where the tip of the ink is recesed and soon i wo n't be able to use it . have n't had time to return it . i have only had it a couple of weeks

yes , very well . my wife and i have an imac and a macbook pro - originally ran os x 10.6.x and now are running os x mavericks ( 10.9 ) . the epson workforce wf-3520 works with them perfectly , both directly attached and wirelessly . the scanner and printing features , like the double-sided printing , work without any trouble or hassle . the only thing we have n't tried is faxing because our home business does things electronically ( such as pdfs ) instead of faxes .
it measures 34 '' with the wheels attached . it 's a great cart . lightweight but does heavyweight work .
