telezapper tz 900 . not only does this handy gadget screen telemarketing calls for you , it also helps to ensure they wo n't keep trying to get ahold of you . the telezapper from privacy technologies plugs into any phone or phone jack . it works by emitting a special tone that makes your number appear disconnected to computer-generated calls . eventually , as your number is eliminated from lists , the calls become a rarity , rather than routine . it wo n't interfere with manually dialed calls , answering machines , voicemail , caller id or call waiting . however , it may remove your number from the lists of organizations that use dialer computers . easy installation . no monthly fees or service charges . ac adapter and phone cord included . charcoal gray . no . tz 900. imported . 3hx7wx5d '' . when you 've had your dinner interrupted by a telemarketer one too many times , treat your phone line and yourself to the telezapper tz 900. it 's a simple , one-time-cost solution to the problem of annoying telemarketing calls . based on the enormously popular classic telezapper , the newer telezapper tz 900 offers the advantages of a slimmer profile , built-in battery power , and an advanced three-tone mode . here 's how it works : given that more than 90 percent of telemarketing calls are placed with computer assistance , when either you or your answering machine answers the phone , the telezapper emits a special tone that tells the computer your number has been permanently disconnected . telemarketing companies that use automated dialing systems typically remove disconnected numbers from their calling lists , and as your phone number is eliminated from more and more telemarketing lists , you 'll notice fewer calls . of course , not all telemarketers use predictive dialing systems , and those that do will undoubtedly continue their work to evade the telezapper , but it can be a partial solution . most predictive dialing systems will be fooled by the telezapper 's standard single tone . however , for newer dialing systems ( presumably designed in response to the success of the previous telezapper model ) , the tz 900 offers an advance three-tone mode . to change the mode , unscrew and remove the protective case and then slide a recessed switch .

canon photo paper pro platinum , 8.5 x 11 inches , 20 sheets ( 2768b022 ) . the ultimate in photo paper quality everything photo paper can possibly have for the artwork of professional and advanced amateur photographers canon 's new flagship glossy photo paper surpasses photo paper pro [ pr-101 ] . similar to photo paper plus glossy ii ( pp-201 ) , a six layer paper structure is used to promote color reproduction `` alumina '' which proved quicker ink absorbency on photo paper pro [ pr -101 ] is adopted in the ink-receiving layers . advancing the texture and quality of canon 's new glossy photo paper `` make the best photo paper in all aspects . '' this was our commitment when we were developing photo paper pro [ pr-101 ] , which was canon 's previous flagship photo paper . to further progress , we follow this commitment and have developed canon 's new flagship glossy photo paper . ink-receiving layers are functionally separated into a color-reproduction layer and an absorbing layer , and a chromogenic enhancer which amplifies light is added into the resin-coat layer . a neutral white which has a high degree of whiteness is adopted for the color of the paper . the demanding photo quality needs of professional and advanced amateur photographer is realized when used with canon 's 2008 new dye-based inks [ cli-221 ] . the color reproduction in red areas is expanded , rich and deep blacks are achieved and the higher image durability is achieved . the best glossy photo paper which turns printouts to artwork . that is photo paper pro platinum [ pt-101 ] . for professional and advanced amateur photographers photo paper pro platinum [ pt- 101 ] exceeds photo paper pro [ pr-101 ] by using original material technology neutral bright white for maximum appeal to professional advanced amateur photographers a new standard for white has been introduced there are various `` whites '' for a white paper such as bluish white , yellowish white , dark white and bright white . the `` white '' canon chose for professional 's and advanced amateur 's artwork from these various `` whites '' is the `` white '' which combines `` crispy white '' and `` neutral white '' . `` crispy white '' contributes to enhance the gamut volume . this provides more vivid color reproduction . and this vividness wo n't be unnatural thanks to the `` neutral white '' . it will produce a natural color which dye itself produces . there are scenes where the whiteness of photo paper pro platinum [ pt-101 ] will be utilized such as the gradation of a morning glow in which colors blend intricately , the transparency of a glass and the texture of metals . but it is on the human skin which is the most common but the most difficult to express that it will show the most obvious whiteness . ink absorption is speedy and dyes are fixed to a top layer in the paper . that is why images can be expressed beautifully and smoothly because of the alumina , quick ink absorbency is achieved the shape of alumina pigment which is the pro_main material in the ink-receiving layers of photo paper pro platinum [ pt- 101 ] is `` plate-like '' . on the other hand , silica pigment which is often used for affordable photo paper is a `` spherical shape '' . both alumina and silica use binders which play a gluing role to join pigments but a `` plate-like '' alumina uses less binders , so it can absorb inks quicker than the silica ink-receiving layers . because the layer is separated into two layers , quick solid-liquid separation is achieved the ink-receiving layers of photo paper pro platinum [ pt- 101 ] are separated into two layers and the amount of binder in each layer is optimized . it gives specific functions for each layer , the top layer is for color reproduction and the bottom layer is for absorption . this is how solid-liquid separation of color material elements and solvent elements can be processed quickly . more vivid color and higher resolution compared to photo paper pro [ pr-101 ] , which has a single ink-receiving layer , is achieved . since alumina is adopted and the ink-receiving layers are separated into two layers , photo paper pro platinum [ pt-101 ] is able to produce prints with richer gradation , smoother expression , more vivid color and higher resolution . the dye is fixed to the surface of the paper , resulting in deeper blacks and a clearer overall photographic finish deeper blacks in combination with new black dye ink there are various blacks for the `` black '' in photographs such as bluish black , yellowish black , reddish black and greenish black . a deep , rich black is a `` black '' that looks truly black to the eye . rich , deep blacks are not only important for reproducing deep-black areas of photos , they also contribute to the overall density , contrast and vividness of the photo . if the black is light , it weakens the photo 's impact , and makes the photo plain . photo paper pro platinum [ pt-101 ] is developed to produce a deep , rich black by fixing the dye close to the surface of the paper . canon has also been trying to make the black ink neutral , and achieved the creation of the deeper `` black '' in combination with photo paper pro platinum [ pt-101 ] and 2008 new dye-based black ink [ cli-221 ] . photos are beautifully reproduced because the dye is fixed close to the surface of the paper the ink-receiving layer on the surface of the paper accepts the dyes in the ink and produces the color . if this layer is too thick , the dyes will spread into the bottom making it difficult to gain enough density . however by making the ink-receiving layer simply thinner , it causes the water in the ink to overflow to the paper 's surface . quick solid-liquid separation fixes the dye to the surface of the paper photo paper pro platinum [ pt-101 ] solves this dilemma using innovative inkjet coating technology . using this technology , the ink-receiving layer is split into two layers , a color-reproduction layer on which the dye is fixed and an absorbing layer that soaks up the excess water solvent . this layered structure enables the dye to be fixed closer to the surface of the paper , improving the density of the black ink compared with photo paper pro [ pr-101 ] . this novel technology achieves rich , deep blacks and bright , vivid photographic results . at the same time , the absorbing layer quickly mops up excess water solvent , for crisp , sharp image quality . enhancement for color reproduction in red areas and the ability to express expands further wider color gamut makes artworks of professionals and advanced amateurs more attractive the wider the color gamut is , the more colors that can be reproduced . the combination of photo paper pro platinum [ pt-101 ] and 2008 new dye-based inks [ cli-221 ] greatly expands color reproduction especially in red areas ( yellow ~ red ~ magenta ) compared to the combination of photo paper pro [ pr-101 ] and the previous dye ink [ cli-8 ] . it brings out pixma 's full ability to produce photos and achieves the reproduction of richer and more vivid colors . color reproduction is stabilized faster than ever before , so you can appreciate the beauty of your photos right away optical density immediately after printing is greater than ever , so you see the real colors of your photos , right away with ordinary inkjet paper , the colors emerge gradually so you can not quickly see the final results of the photo including color and contrast . photo paper pro platinum [ pt-101 ] is a completely different experience . the optical density ( color density ) is high immediately after printing , and color reproduction happens fast . in less time than ever , a reproduction of the colors of the original photo is complete . images are bright and vivid as soon as the print job is finished . improved durability ( light fastness gas fastness ) by adding the new durability enhancer in ink-receiving layers canon focused on both paper and ink , and worked on things paper can do and things ink can do to improve image durability of photo prints . based on the discoloration mechanisms ( presumption ) of the color material , the discoloration of color material have been successfully minimized by adding the new durability enhancer in the ink-receiving layers . mechanisms for photo image deterioration ( presumption ) the mechanisms for photo image deterioration ( presumption ) caused by gas and light . canon presumed the mechanisms of discoloration of printouts is pro_mainly caused by these three deteriorative reactions listed below . the reaction of incoming gas deteriorates the color material the deteriorative chain reaction starts because of the material generated in the process above the chain reaction of light through oxygen deteriorates the color material the approach to photo paper pro platinum [ pt-101 ] canon discovered the `` new additives '' to minimize the discoloration of the color material from the discoloration mechanisms of printouts and successfully introduced it to photo paper pro platinum [ pt-101 ] .

fellowes powershred ds-3 10 sheet cross-cut paper and credit card shredder with safesense technology ( 3231001 ) . the fellowes powershred ds-3 cross-cut shredder can shred up to 10 sheets of paper per pass into 302 ( 5 32 x 2 security level p-3 ) cross-cut particles . this machine also safely shreds credit cards , staples , and paper clips . to protect more than your identity , the patented safesense technology is designed with an electronic safety sensor that surrounds the paper entry and automatically disables the shredder when hands touch the paper opening . with the ability to shred for up to 5 minutes before a cool down period is needed , the ds-3 is ideal for personal deskside use and includes a 5-gallon lift-off head with a handle . backed by a worry-free 1-year product and service warranty plus a 5-year cutter warranty . 16.50 '' h x 15.00 '' w x 12.00 '' d protect your personal information with the powershred ds-3 cross-cut shredder from fellowes . part of the company 's line of deskside shredders , this machine is ideal in a home or home office and for individual users who regularly handle sensitive information . it cross-cuts up to 10 sheets of paper in one pass into unreadable pieces ( 5 32 inches by 2 inches ) and is tough enough to shred credit cards , staples , and paper clips . safesense technology automatically stops the shredder when hands touch the paper opening , while a 5-gallon bin makes waste disposal simple . with identity theft concerns at an all-time high , the need to protect personal information is more important than ever . and these days , it 's no longer just what you shred that matters -- it 's how small you shred it . shredders with a smaller cut size will help keep your information secure long after you dispose of the particles . the smaller the cut size , the higher the security level . if you shred confidential documents , choose cross-cut or smaller . a smaller cut size also means you will empty the bin less frequently . shredder productivity goes beyond mere sheet capacity or speed . when shopping for a shredder , consider the machine 's throughput , or the efficiency with which it can get the job done . throughput combines the three most critical features that contribute to a shredder 's performance : for example , a shredder with a speed of 8.2 feet per minute ( fpm ) , may seem more productive than one that shreds at only 7 fpm . after all , it 's a faster machine ! but as the example below illustrates , shredder b is actually three times more productive than shredder a , due to a longer duty cycle . this means you can get more done at one time , so you can quickly move on with your day . we understand that a shredder is not just a purchase . it 's an investment . that 's why fellowes drives quality assurance to exceed expectations . prior to launch , all fellowes shredders are subjected to extensive field and laboratory tests , including our proprietary continuous abuse test and long-term wear . these tests simulate years of abnormally high use to ensure our products perform reliably , even under the most demanding conditions . our promise to you is supported by a commitment to offer the most innovative solutions , exceptional product quality , and first class service and support . our higher standards ensure you get the most reliable shredder you can buy .
