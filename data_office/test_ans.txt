hi belle ! this is a laser copier .
yes . just lay the open book on the top of the unit and press copy , making sure the book does n't fall off during carriage movement .
yes , please contact me powell ( at ) hartcom ( dot ) netthanks !
no , it 's black and white only .
i 'm running it stand alone .
you 'd have to set the light dark setting toward lighter - if you do n't , the b &w; will be mostly dark and you wo n't be able to distinguish much
yes , it does a nice job .
robert , yes , toner is included . we are finding the canon pc430 to be a good home copier . i have not gotten a replacement toner to have as a spare , but plan on doing that soon . hope this helps , bill
i have 2 spare rolls of the labels and on the brother packaging it 's states 12mm x 8m which equates to about 25feethope that answers your queryregards
yes i looked your model lable maker up and it uses num d1 cartridge
yes , mine was two cartridges , 23'long . that 's a bunch of labels ... .. i 'm still using the first roll , so ca n't tell you how the second one functions : ) well worth the money !
the standard length is 23 ft for this part number . i expect that the seller made a mistake and put 13 ft as an overlay on the photo by mistake . the best way to verify is to check with the seller .
yes , you can center and seal item inside of plastic cover then trim with a sharp blade or scissors .
if i understand the question , my answer would be no . this would not be my choice of laminate material for a number of reasons . typically i would expect more damage to the material if you tried to complete a re-do and i think there would be some distortion that would not make you happy . i 'd recommend going to a `` hobby '' shop for info on better products . if what you are laminating is not of particular value and you are not a perfectionist , this product will probably give you some limited satisfaction .
depends on exactly what you are trying to laminate . the `` pouches '' are sturdy but flexible plastic . one side has adhesive and the other does not . the adhesive sticks to one side of the material being laminated and seals to the plastic side where it extends beyond material being laminated . the resulting unit can be trimmed as desired as long as a reasonable margin , say 1 8 '' or more is left beyond the edge of the material laminated . the material to be laminated should be reasonably thin , perhaps not thicker than good construction paper . the resulting laminated unit is quite sturdy . if your letters and projects meet these conditions and are within the specified size limits , the product should work satisfactorily . depends on exactly what you are trying to laminate . the `` pouches '' are sturdy but flexible plastic . one side has adhesive and the other does not . the adhesive sticks to one side of the material being laminated and seals to the plastic side where it extends beyond material being laminated . the resulting unit can be trimmed as desired as long as a reasonable margin , say 1 8 '' or more is left beyond the edge of the material laminated . the material to be laminated should be reasonably thin , perhaps not thicker than good construction paper . the resulting laminated unit is quite ... » read more depends on exactly what you are trying to laminate . the `` pouches '' are sturdy but flexible plastic . one side has adhesive and the other does not . the adhesive sticks to one side of the material being laminated and seals to the plastic side where it extends beyond material being laminated . the resulting unit can be trimmed as desired as long as a reasonable margin , say 1 8 '' or more is left beyond the edge of the material laminated . the material to be laminated should be reasonably thin , perhaps not thicker than good construction paper . the resulting laminated unit is quite sturdy . if your letters and projects meet these conditions and are within the specified size limits , the product should work satisfactorily . « show less
have n't tried the matte finish - but the clear finish seems to have worked well !
no they are not .
these are original dymo labels . i have used them and they are defiantly originals .
yes they should . i have used different types of labels and i have had no problems .
they work perfectly in my dymo 400 turbo , so i would guess they should work in the 450 twin .
yes . the labels are not changed physically by the printer .
i would say so . i have not had any problems with them .
the d-1 labels for the bottom feeder are glossy . the 30333 top feeder are a matte finish .
i do n't know the actual thickness -- but it works fine in my several-year-old printer which uses ordinary standard printing paper .
10 labels per sheet . just like it says on the box
8 3 4 x 11 1 4
they are matte . they are the same as a regular sheet of paper , but they have a dark backing ( where the glue is ) that blocks any writing that may be on the envelope under the label . i hope this helps .
yes , i have that model and it works with mine .
yes
just ink
when i bought my typewriter brother had no ribbon with it i bought brother 1430i ribbon i called the typewriter company they sent me a free alphabet wheels for it also
if you have the brother 1230 there should be a lever by the ribbon or next to it somewhere in the top area , pull it forward i believe and it just lifts out and put in the new ribbon and close the lever back .
hi don , do n't remember actually . do remember that each time i changed it was like doing it for the first time . i had to be very diligent about paying attention to how the older one was placed , i.e . was the ribbon in front or in back of certain guides , before i removed it . may take a couple tries but i always do get it in and seated correctly .
i just hit the total ( * ) button a second time and it clears the registers
yes , and buying on amazon is cheaper then buying from businesses in hawaii .
yes they do . i have had mine for several years and it 's still going strong .
once you set it up , it prints out on the paper , as long as you have the date time button on .
small paper manual came with mine . try google search for : manual for sharp el-1197piii calculator . i 'll bet there 's one online .
set it to a ( where the k and a are ) then set it to what ever number places you want at the 0 1 2 3 6 f .
it does . i 've never used it , but there is a button you push for time and date .

as i recall , this machine was a piece of c**p. it did not last long at all and it was n't cheap . i now have a sharp , which seems to be holding up pretty well . good luck !

i can think of three different ways to use a constant percentage on a list of numbers using this calculator . probably the most straight forward approach would be to load the constant in the memory and using the memory subtotal function to enter this figure anywhere you need it in the calculation . *the drawback is that you can not use the memory section for anything else . the second method applies if the only time you need to multiply or divide is in calculating the percentage needed . in this case enter the constant percentage needed first and then hit the multiply button and enter the number you want to calculate by hitting the equal key to obtain the desired result . to calculate subsequent numbers enter the number to calculate and hit the equal key only . it will remember the constant percentage you entered previously . you can then either add or subtract the resulting numbers using main calculating section or the memory function . the third method is by using the tax calculating function . if the percentage is greater than 100 % set this feature using the amount exceeding 100 % and use the tax+ button . for example , if you want to calculate 104 % enter 4 % ( 104 % minus 100 % ) when setting the function . then once you enter the number you want to calculate and hit the tax+ key it will calculate 4 % of that value and add the original value to that 4 % calculated value resulting in 104 % . if the percentage is less than 100 % the procedure is slightly more complicated . for instance , if you want to calculate 96 % , you will need to set the constant rate for tax calculation to the inverse of the desired rate and then use the tax- key for the result . in this case , you would find the inverse by dividing 1.00 by 0.96 ( the decimal equivalents for 100 % and 96 % ) which is 1.04166666666. enter the inverse of the constant percentage you want to calculate when setting the tax function and use the tax- key whenever you need to calculate a percentage less than 100 % . what will happen is this machine will calculate the difference of the desired result and the original number and then subtract that number from the original number to obtain the desired result . the advantage here is than you can then use any other function on the calculator as you go through your list of numbers . i can think of three different ways to use a

2 1 4 '' i do not recommend this calculator though . mine did n't last very long .
it is 7.0 '' long x 3.5 '' wide x 1.5 '' thick . no you have to have a wire holder for it to hold .
yes to both .
the ink comes with it in the form off an inked roller which is actually part of the machine . i do not recall if the paper was included . i may have transferred the paper roll across from the calculator i was replacing .
it does come with a manuel but is very easy to use it does not come with a wall charger tho
troy , i looked on the box , and could not find an expiration date at all !
yes
i have 1 original in an open box
we have a hp 4600 machine i am not sure what your question is.yes i bought order this number of ink . i have an order for this ink right now.i have received it yet .
any of the black box toners ( color of the box ) should be fine . i am seeing a lot of people showing pictures of the black box 's but sending the blue colored ones which are pretty old , i would not recommend using .
that date is the warranty . it can print 13,000 pages 5 % ( if you buy 3 , it will long 39000 print pages ) i use it 3 moth after date whitout problems .
the 4600 printer indicates 8000 pages . obviously that depends on the amount of ink coverage on the page .
it 's a great fax machine , but it is not a network scanner . you are better off with an `` all-in-one '' copier , scanner , printer & fax if that is your requirement . you can find some very good ones in the same price range from hp and dell .
yes it 's take automatically from the tray that have paperregards
yes , and toner .
yes , but if i recall correctly the cartridge it comes with is a `` sample '' cartridge that does not yield the same amount of pages as a new `` full '' cartridge .

diane : the scotch self-laminating package is different from what i purchased before . but the product is the same . i was unable to purchase it locally at my office store , so was glad i found it on amazon.com . it is the same product as i used before , with stiff laminate material , unlike a competitor 's brand that was too flimsy .

yes , this is the kind of scotch self laminating sheets i use and you can use the dry erase pens . thanks , i had never thought of that so had to test it before i answered you . i 've this on so many projects and always pleased .
hello ms. harris ; you are correct , there is no thickness number on the packaging . the laminating sheets i use are ls854-25g , clear front and back . the following are accurate dimensions . the clear base sheet ( with adhesive ) measures 3.5 mil . the transparent cover sheet is 6.5 mil thick giving a total of 10 mil . if the thickness is important , do not forget to add the thickness of the item you are sealing . hope this helps.charlie
yes , i 've cut them for several projects , like book-marks . i 've used good scissors . i do n't know about the other kind of cutters . good luck .
it has openings for screws but no hooks screws . you could use command hooks or cup hooks . i think push pins wo n't be strong enough .

yes , it will ! i 'm really happy with this product . it is a lot better built , sturdier and heavier , than other paper cutters i 've had .
yes i believe so .
not sure if its self sharpening but it sure is a great cutter .
i would not try that , the knife blade had a torsion spring and would most likely just move the knife edge away from the board .
buy new blade
sure . the template is just a word document . just make sure the first time that except for the 10 , the remainder of the document is blank .
i used these labels on metal and they come off fairly easily .
i do n't know if they are vinyl but do n't think so . it does n't say what they are made of anywhere on the package but they feel like very strong paper . i do n't know about oil either . we use them outside on garden stakes and some have lasted over 8 years . they have been sprayed with garden bug killers and weed killers with no damage . sorry i ca n't be of more help
i did once accidentally run them through my inkjet , and the ink smeared badly . only use them in a laser.however , you can mark on them with a sharpie if you are just looking for a weatherproof label and do n't have a laser .
yes
no , they are not .
these appear to be about the same thickness as my 65 # cardstock . hope that helps .
12 ' ( height ) x 12 '' ( width ) x 9 '' ( deep )
the shelves are 2 1 2 '' apart and each shelf is 8 1 2 '' long ( deep ) .

each slot has 2 3 4 `` depth
yes , but the 8.5 '' side will hang over the lip
12 '' h , 12 '' w , 9 '' depth
it 's about 27 inches . but you can adjust it easily to make it longer or shorter . i like this one a lot . i would order again .

hello , i believe you can scan swipe your id while it is in this pouch . i swipe scan my subway transportation card all the time , while in this pouch . this pouch is great for items like this .
no
ca n't tell you exactly . my postal scale ( which is the only scale i have in my office ) only goes up to five pounds . the 24 lb . version of this paper weighs more than five pound ( 500 sheet box ) . i would estimate the weight at seven or eight pounds .
not a fountain pen per se , but i 've used different roller ball pens with it , and i 've noticed no problems . given the surface , i 'd expect no problems with a fountain pen .
ivory is basically like a manila folder . it 's is very yellowish compared to the white . bright white is white . hope that helps !
i use a laser printer , so bleeding is not a problem . the paper appears to be absorbent , not glossy , so i would not expect inkjet printing to bleed when the paper is folded , but i have no experience on which to base that .
unclear whether or not its linen free . no embossing , just watermarked .
yes , any universal kit will work . this board comes with its own mounting kit .
no
no cleaning fluid is needed , although it would n't hurt . we use this in a public university where some of the writing will be left up for days , possibly weeks , and even then there is just the slightest ghost of what was there before when erased simply with a dry eraser .
no
i believe it will .
in a cool dry location about 3 years
it was an exact fit for my super 12 .
yes .

the actual size is 8 inches by 11 inches . i use these in a binder and it works good .
if you mean do they fall out of the holder they do n't . the open end is on theinside next to the rings so they stay put . i have used many many of these for my pictures and they work great .
i have not tried that . sorry i ca n't help !
i am not sure i have never had to change it yet.sorry
it has two horizontal and two vertical strips of graduations , and they are down to 1 8 '' . the main grid throughout is 1 '' squares .
hi , yes the flat bed measures 12 tall and the cutting edge will accommodate a 12 inch paper . i would think that to cut off 1 8 - 1 4 it would be wise to pre-mark the two edges ( top and bottom ) to get an accurate cut
replacement parts are listed on the back of the cutter and are available through amazon . i have used the cutter for almost five years and have not had occasion to replace any parts - love the machine .
not recommended
yes , this has cm and in .
no , mine came without a clip . as for the gift box , it is just a basic and simple plastic box , not at all fancy . i would not put a wedding ring in such a box .
i tried it , mine does on a dry bag but not a wet one . it does n't write well , but possibly well enough . watch out the pen point does n't damage the surface of the bag . i think a marker of some sort might be better for this application .
yes it is
the `` cap-o-matic '' is the retractable version . can not answer the second question as i have only been using mine sparingly about 3 months .
no , the pen with the cap on is only about 2 inches long . the cap is taken off and turned around to make it full size to write .
mark , i believe `` 400 '' is the model number for the pen with gift box , not the quantity . the price is for one pen.hope this will help.regardswilson
the item comes in a nicely designed box with a black hard case that holds it and an astronaut and space themed graphic sleeve covering it . very cool .
you have to buy the pressurized refills from the fisher company .
the short answer is no . the foot of the stand is two tubes that are as wide ( one leg of mine is a bit wider ) than the top . so if stacked , it would be very unstable and i am sure you would have it fall off one side or the other eventually . what you could do is place two small boards or a piece of plywood or rods or whatever as a platform across the top . would not look good . actually that is a great question and when i looked at it its too bad because if it would work , i would get another one myself . but aside from the adding a platform of some sort , would not work .
the shelf below the main shelf is 15 inches wide . that shelf curves outwards at the sides so that something 17 inches wide would fit . the height from the main shelf to the one below is approx . 2 inches . the height from the lower shelf to a table top is approx . 2.5 inches .
there is a scant 2 1 2 inches from the desk to the lower shelf , and a scant 2 1 2 inches from the lower shelf to the upper shelf . i have to add that i am very , very pleased with it .
i have only got a small flat screen tv and set top box on mine . no sweat . i believe it is pretty strong , though . i would't hesitate to put a heavier tv on it . i love mine .
it 's all going to come down to the width of the computer . a 15 '' macbook pro fits underneath just fine , but you might have to raise it up just a bit due to ports so that the connected cables can exit the side cleanly .
i did not find this product easy to work with . did n't have a problem with bleeding or yellowing ; however you can forget the repositioning and it 's messy as all get out being a spray . i did not find it user friendly for small things . much more adapted to big surfaces where it does n't matter if the spray hits areas other than where you want to seal something . i wo n't be purchasing this product again .
i used it on metal and it worked great . not sure about rubber , but it is so sticky i would think it should be fine .
i sincerely doubt it . i did not have good luck with this product and was very disappointed it did not do what it claimed .
mist spray
yes the faster you apply them together , after applying the 3m spray to both sides of the foam the better .
operates efficiently and continuously in temperatures ranging from -7 ° c to 90 ° c .
no there is n't a secondary battery back up . however there are 4 aa batteries that saves the memory .
no , i just use one department and i love it . i only use it on battery because i do festivals and have to pay so much more for electricity . i love my new cash register . all i did was program my tax . i use one dept . for taxed items and one for not . any other questions , let me know .
the part number is 013109 , but it is a roller not a cartridge . they come two to a blister pack and cost about $ 5.00 . i 've had mine about 3 years and have yet to change the roller .
no
we found that you do have to push drawer to open , not a big deal really . it 's just a tap . have had this cash register for 4 years now and would buy it again . t
it does not make beeping or dinging noises . i use my cash register at a farmers ' market and would not like all the noise either .
yes on the bottom of the phone itself it has a switch for hi and low volume and a switch for on and off and pulse and rotary . the cord from the phone to the receiver is permanent ( can not be took out ) but the phone jack cord can be as long as you like it to be..
no
heavy gauge plastic . it 's good and solid . the phone is heavy , not as heavy as the old ones but still solid .
the cable line is about 8 feet long , and the coiled phone cord is about 22 inches coiled . of course , the phone cord can be stretched out .
mine is a true `` cardinal '' red ; rich , not burgundy , or orange-y . very pleased with mine .
ren = 0.9b
no
the cord is only on the left side , not modular and very short .
the cord is black on the red phone and it is an inch shy of 7 feet . you can replace it with any r11 cord , so you can extend the length to any size you want or make it any color - tan , white , clear - whatever .
i tried and it would n't work .
phone was no good , so i sent it back for a refund and then i bought a uniden phone and this phone is great . by the way i bought the panasonic a long time ago . i saydo not buy the panasonic.spend a little more money and buy the uniden , big buttons , speaker , mute , redial , etc.. have a nice day..
roughly 5.5 x 8.0
no you can not .
yes , as pictured
the seller never replied to me , however , amazon refunded my purchase .
no , it is a fake .
all of our items are 100 % authentic . as for the engraving , we do not offer the option having the item engraved .
it adjusts to 3 height settings .
probably , but it depends on the width of the opening in your desk . our desk was 24 5 8 , and that 's about minimum for mounting this drawer . i had to reverse the rails ( easy to do ) in order to get it to fit . so you would need another 8-9 '' to leave the mouse tray open .
yes it is removable .
technically , i ca n't say that it is because i had our maintenance guy install it . but , he was able to do it without complaint . i think installation is straight forward .
yes if it is fully extended .
it 's a pretty sturdy drawer for the most part , but i believe it would n't hold up to resting on it . i tried it and i feel if i had put all my weight on it , it would probably have broken . as far as using it for the keyboard and normal use it has held up very well for me and i 'm satisfied with my choice in it .
the tracks are15 '' long . it will definitely fit under a desk 18 '' wide . the tray itself is 23 '' long x 14 '' wide .
it would depend on what kind of ergonomic keyboard you have . if it is raised , maybe not . the keyboard drawer has three different levels you can use , the lowest giving you an additional 1 1 2 '' .
yes
the width of the stand is 19 '' and the depth from front to back is 14 '' . the height is 4 '' and the space under the drawer is 2 1 4 '' .i have two of them . one at work and one at home . in my option a good monitor stand .
unlikely to accommodate that . space under is 2 inches high by 14 3 4 inches wide . from desk to top is 4 inches . if you want to use the laptop in the open position it would partially block an external monitor and there is a drawer above that which your laptop would make unaccessible .
yes . less than an inch . you do realize the height is adjustable through the feet ?
yes , should be able to . just make sure all the cartridge slots at least have the empty ones in them , and run the scan via the software on your computer . not via the buttons on the face of printer .
try conecting to via serial port , or try different usb ports .
no . 780 uses the ink of the pixma 4000830 has some new crummy encoded cartirdge !
the only difference i can see is that the 830 has a built-in memory card reader . pull the card out of your digital camera and print without a computer.but , maybe i missed something ...
my black print was horable as well . my 3e bk was not printing well at all . i followed the instructions above removing all inks removed the print head holder and began to clean the bottom with rubbing alcohol and q-tips . i then took the two screws out of the head pulled it back and took my air comresser and held an air tip to the inside of the holder onto the where the ink goes in and sure enough a clog removed itself from the 3e port.my printer is like brand new.do n't bother calling canon they want to charge you 9.95 to answer questions .
buy a print server that will connect into your wireless router . you can find generic ones for about $ 50 , lexmark also makes one but it goes for $ 150 .
we have had photos in them for over 25 years and all is still like new ... ... .
do n't see why not . you would just lift the cover sheet , place stamps and any label or information on the board and recover . it should hold everything nicely .
not normal . return them .
no it does not
they are perfect for the regular 3-hole binders . as others said they are 9x11 in . and it is 4.5in between the holes . the area that you can use for the photos is 8.5x11 in .
i forget how many come with the package , but i have researched this for a long time and finding what i wanted was near impossible and when i purchased this i was delighted not only with the quality , but the quantity and price .
mine have done fine . if you want to be extra certain , you could add a small amount of acid free tape used in card making and scrapbooking . good luck .
i imagine the forms they will be sending are for the current tax year . you may want to send a message directly to the company if you 're not certain .
yes
no , they do not come with envelopes .
no
copy a is the red copy for irs and that has to be an approved form . copy 1 for state tax department from payer . copy b is for the recipient . copy 2 is for the recipient to send with there state tax return if required . copy c is for the payee ( you )
they are 2014 which is what you need for this filing season .
yes they are
the ones i purchased were compatible with qbooks ; however , when i ordered these forms in december 2014 , i received 1099s for 2013 ! amazon gave a credit to my account . i did n't re-order but used the free ones from the irs instead since i only had a few to do anyway .
no
1 4 inch is the recomended lenght of the leg of the staple . i use max staples with it , it is a standard staple . all of my desktop staplers uses this size , i use different colors . 26 6 using milimeters the 6mm being the leg of the staple .
you can pull it back to open it to load staples , but as far as i can tell you ca n't open it to staple something on a wall . i could be wrong but i just played with it and could n't find a setting to open it so i could staple paper to a wall .
it takes the standard ones . really convenient , i love it .
i 've been using the same cheap , garden variety , no-name 26 6 staples in this flat clinch stapler as i was previously using in my old bubble-clinch stapler . i 'm not particularly of the impression that a special flat-clinch staple even exists . the only significant difference is the mechanics of the unit , so the same staple should perform equally as well , albeit flattened .
for one thing , this is n't a high capacity stapler . i would n't go much beyond 15-20 sheets . as to noise - about average . no loud pop , but not silent either . similar to other desk staplers .
it 's like a normal pencil but without the wood . this also depends on the hard softness of the lead .
there must be a mistake in the description . the lead holder is in fact refillable .
lead holder vs mechanical pencil ... i use both on a daily basis . as for the difference . i will start with the obvious , the lead holder uses a 2mm lead instead of the .5mm , .7mm , or .9mm lead that the mechanical pencil offers . you can also get the 2mm lead in a variety of colors and hardness 's depending on your needs . i mostly use my lead holders for shading purposes in my drawings but i have done some complete drawings with them . as for the $ 1 variety of mechanical pencils always remember that you get what you pay for . if you plan on doing a lot of drawing spend the extra money and get a quality mechanical pencil , i promise you wont be disappointed . lead holder vs mechanical pencil ... i use both on a daily basis . as for the difference . i will start with the obvious , the lead holder uses a 2mm lead instead of the .5mm , .7mm , or .9mm lead that the mechanical pencil offers . you can also get the 2mm lead in a variety of colors and hardness 's depending on your needs . i mostly use my lead holders for shading purposes in my drawings but i have done some complete drawings with them . as for the $ 1 variety of mechanical pencils always remember that you get what you pay for . if you plan on doing a lot of drawing spend the extra money and get a ... » read more lead holder vs mechanical pencil ... i use both on a daily basis . as for the difference . i will start with the obvious , the lead holder uses a 2mm lead instead of the .5mm , .7mm , or .9mm lead that the mechanical pencil offers . you can also get the 2mm lead in a variety of colors and hardness 's depending on your needs . i mostly use my lead holders for shading purposes in my drawings but i have done some complete drawings with them . as for the $ 1 variety of mechanical pencils always remember that you get what you pay for . if you plan on doing a lot of drawing spend the extra money and get a quality mechanical pencil , i promise you wont be disappointed . « show less
mine came with a single stick of 2h . so if youre drawing writing with it you might want to buy a softer lead . you can get them at your local art store .
i do n't know the paper weight but i will say they are well made of excellent quality material . i have used nearly half of my original order & will reorder soon . have n't had any complaints from my mail recipients .
yes
everything is blank . i just nearly write on it with a sharpie .
no , it it under 9 '' in width on the outside .
have you tried avery 5390 ? it takes a little dexterity and patience to slide it into the badge holder without wrinkling , but size fits well .
sure -- if you want to use them for lanyards at conferences or something i 'm sure you could get multiple uses out of them . you would slip the old card out and slip a new one in . the plastic is heavy enough i 've been wearing a badge in one for about six months , and it 's holding up fine .
well ... it 's made of plastic but surely you can stick one to it ... . i 'm not sure i understand your question
there is a slot for a snap button lanyard for your neck . they are nice . but be carful , there is two kinds , one with the slot at the top and one on the side . hope this helps you . the one that is showing to the left , is the one with it one the side . the other one is longer and the slot it at the end of it . terry
i 'm not sure about glossy badges but i used the avery 5390 , it 's not glossy but it fit nicely in the badge and the avery website is easy to use .
yes it would i had a large name taq , i also carried a small amount of cash and a couple of hotel room keys , i am sure it would hold a credit card or two . it just does n't close , so would n't be the most secure of places for a credit card .
yes , that is correct . it is a very sturdy plastic , not the cheap throw away type .
paper not in correctly
if you are going to purchase another 922 then i 'm pretty sure that all you have to do is plug in the new one . if you use a different model number then you must go to `` printers and faxes '' and click on the `` add a printer '' , insert the cd to download the new information needed for the new printer to work .
it copies , scans and you can fax with it . i got it with my computer 7 years ago and bought 3 more for spares as you can no longer purchase them from dell.i love it and you only need 2 ink cartridges , a black and a color .
given that i am very short & most chairs are made for taller people , this device has saved my life . therefore , if it slips a little and occasionally makes noise while doing so , so be it . i bring it everywhere , so i 've used it on wood , tile , concrete & carpets . obviously , it wo n't slide on a carpet , but , oh well ... .
once it is open you just rest your feet or foot on it . i bought it to use on an airplane and it does n't work very well for me . i am 5'1 '' tall and it slides too much on the carpet in the airplane . still it is better than nothing and i plan on trying to fix the sliding issue with a diy fix .
be sure that the folding supports , inside the top on both sides , have lowered and are `` snapped open '' . the pressure of your feet on the top will ensure continued holding of the open position . mine has made a huge improvement in my back and knee problems . good luck with yours .
it is very low to the ground . probably only 8-10 inches in height
i just measured mine and it is 8 '' x 4 '' x 4 `` .
once set up , there are brackets to hold it open . when you are ready to pack it up , the brackets fold back , and it becomes slightly larger than a woman 's wallet . i am happy i bought mine .
11.9 ounces
i do n't know ..but this one did n't work in my pixmaip6222od as it said it would
yes , mine is over 1 year and 3 months old , and it still prints fine .
yes , that is the model that i have .have used several of these cartridges , last longer than the smaller ones .
amazon listed the 51 as an accessory to the 470 printer , and like an idiot i bought it , without reading the review that said it did n't fit . it does n't !
you need a usb cable . you can buy them at any electronics store - amazon and walmart included . there are different lengths and they are not usually included with new printers anymore . you want a cable long enough to reach from where the printer sits to one of the usb ports on the front or back of your computer . once you plug in the power cable for the printer and the usb cable , then turn the printer on , hopefully , your computer will detect the new hardware automatically and load the appropriate printer driver . if not you should be able to download the driver for your operating system ( windows vista , windows 7 , etc . ) at this link : http : www.usa.canon.com cusa support consumer printers_multifunction pixma_mp_series pixma_mp500 # driversandsoftware if the link does n't come through , just go to canon.com - click on support and select the appropriate location , operating system , etc . you will be looking for support and drivers . i hope this helps . you need a usb cable . you can buy them at any electronics store - amazon and walmart included . there are different lengths and they are not usually included with new printers anymore . you want a cable long enough to reach from where the printer sits to one of the usb ports on the front or back of your computer . once you plug in the power cable for the printer and the usb cable , then turn the printer on , hopefully , your computer will detect the new hardware automatically and load the appropriate printer driver . if not you should be able to download the driver for your operating system ... » read more you need a usb cable . you can buy them at any electronics store - amazon and walmart included . there are different lengths and they are not usually included with new printers anymore . you want a cable long enough to reach from where the printer sits to one of the usb ports on the front or back of your computer . once you plug in the power cable for the printer and the usb cable , then turn the printer on , hopefully , your computer will detect the new hardware automatically and load the appropriate printer driver . if not you should be able to download the driver for your operating system ( windows vista , windows 7 , etc . ) at this link : http : www.usa.canon.com cusa support consumer printers_multifunction pixma_mp_series pixma_mp500 # driversandsoftware if the link does n't come through , just go to canon.com - click on support and select the appropriate location , operating system , etc . you will be looking for support and drivers . i hope this helps . « show less
works like its only a day old
i have this mp500 printer . it is not capable of scanning negatives . there 's nothing in the manual covering negative scanning .
canon support will walk you through any problem you may have with the printer . they provide free lifetime support on their printers and will walk you through the process of cleaning or diagnosing a problem . phone : 1-800-ok-canon or 1-800-652-2666
i had the same problems . very infuriating . finally found that if i ran the `` bottom plate cleaning '' maintenance ( push `` menu '' and then select `` maintenance '' options ; scroll down to botttom plate cleaning , last on list . ) 5-6 times in succession it would clear up the problem .
hello and good day . the 3210 was a capable printer . when it worked . for i did had soft ware issues , i had to delete everything an reinstall . but for me was the feed mechanism . over an over an over , paper jams . so got tired an got epson 837. an epson way out performed hp ... . just the issue is inks are expensive .
hp 02 ... .in black , yellow , 2 cyans and 2magenta 's
i really doubt it . now and then there is one for sale on here or ebay that is sold for parts pretty reasonable
no , it is a great printer , copier , scanner , but no fax .
yes , for copies you can use it without a computer .
it does a wonderful job , until you upgrade to vista . at that point , kiss all your really neat features goodbye , because their software that makes it happen no longer works . their best solution ? `` use paint . '' they have no intention of fixing the problem of incompatibility . they want to force you to buy a replacement . so i did , just not hp . hate that attitude .
measured and they are exactly as stated .
i use it for a sewing cutting table , so not sure about maximum weight , but it 's really very sturdy . i store boxes of fabric , a cutting surface , a lamp and a portion of my weight to cut . it never wobbles . i love this table .
yes , thats what i use mine for and there is no shaking of the table at all . very sturdy !
unlined . and they are great !
it is along the 8 inch side !
these only have an adhesive edge on one of the longer sides . hope this helps : )
no this is not wireless printer so you ca n't print from your phone regards
94 96 for black ( 100 is a photo black gray cartridge ) .95 or 97 for colour .
do not buy . they break in a few months . both of mine stopped feeding paper .
no , this is just a fine color ink jet printer ... lots of all-in-ones out there ... just not this one .
bill , yes you can . that 's the main reason i use mine . be advised , with more weight in the portafile , the front latch will not hold . it is weak .
yes , it fits letter and legal size papers
the coating on the cover seems to be colored paper . the cover is about 1 8 '' thick paper or cardboard .
if you 're asking if it will hold legal documents , then the answer is yes . they will fit .
andrew , the imageclass mf3240 does not have wi-fi compatibility nor can it be used on linux .
no it does n't but i am wondering if there is an extra attachment that can be purchased .
no & no
no . it is only black and white but is a great printer .
i use my canon 3240 printer with my dell desktop computer which has windows 7 loaded in it , so not sure about the mac ability . i do love the printer because it helps me to run my small business .
no feeder tray and no w7 64 support . was very unhappy about the lack of support for w7 64 because advert implied otherwise , but decided to keep it because of the price . it has been problem free .
i had this problem when i got a new computer with windows 8.1 but i called canon and they walked me thru the set up and got it working . no charge but it was very complicated and im glad they were able to help . otherwise its been a great printer for several years now .
there are no drivers for 64 bit windows for this printer . you are out of luck .
hi dennis , i have n't tried this myself , but i would guess that this device would struggle to accurately record equations : it will probably mistake greek characters mathematical characters for more common letters , although you may be able to select mathematical formula as the ocr language .
hi , thank you for the interest . we asked ectaco , the brand owner , and they said , `` yes '' , it does work .
i 'm not certain . however , i checked the quickstart guide and saw no reference to `` left hand . `` from my view , i can think of no reason why it would not work for a left handed person .
i had words underlined and it did n't make a difference with mine - still highlighted and transferred just fine
i have used a corded version . ectaco offers a cordless version of the device too .
i do not believe so ... all it is is a scanner . you can use it for enter or return and tab that is about it .
yes , works on win 7 and win 8 , laptop and desktops , have not tried it with win 8.1 .
yes , yes and yes .
they are not thick . the texture would show .
no . as a matter of fact i bought these sheets to use in my laser printer to create a check-out form . it prints on them just fine , but it erases at the slightest touch . not sure if there is another similar product out there that might be better . never took the time to research .
no , it has an adhesive backing . they can be peeled off without leaving any residue behind . the adhesive does seem to get 'weak ' after a few months , but this depends on : ( 1 ) the number of times the sheet has been peeled off and re-affixed , and ( 2 ) the surface to which it is affixed ( on my cabinets at work , the sheets stay indefinitely ; on my refrigerator , the sheet begins to peel after approximately 3 months ) .
you could leave the backing on the pages , and use them as loose pages that are dry-erase . i have found they also work great stuck to the back of a clipboard .
not to take , i use it to write the shopping list , on my kitchen wall . the adhesive is to strong to take it out
they are made in the usa !
they did n't really stick too well . i had to tape then to my wall :
wet erase wipes off very easily with tissue too . not something i think you would want .
yes , i use mine on my stainless steel refrigerator .
i have the obusforme unltraforme back rest , and with it i use the matching obusforme 3 piece seat cushion . works for me . good luck .
exactly , approx . 17.5 wide , 11inches in seat ,
i do n't know if it shreds them , but i leave both staples and paper clips on the paper and it handles it with not problem .
mine is standard 115 volt ac wall power .
16 '' high , 15 '' wide 9 '' front to back , slightly narrower at the base than the top .
i do n't think a replacement basket is available , however you may want contact aurora . hey you never know .
vertical i was very disappointed because i wanted horizontal .
i had to actually count them , because it doesnt say . there are 100 pages !
it cuts my chip board just fine . however , keep in mind that chip board comes in different weights and i ca n't speak for heavier weights .
metal and plastic - the cutting part is very sharp metal and covered on top with a strong plastic .
one of the dimensions must be 12 inches or less because the paper slips under the guide next to the cutting edge . so while i can not cut a 13 x 13 square , i can cut down tabloid or legal sized paper because it is only 11.5 inches wide . it is tricky though because you must be very careful to keep the top edge aligned perfectly with the back side of the cutter -- so if you hurry like i did the first time i tried , you may end up with a crooked cut . however , you still must have paper no wider than 12 inches . hope this helps -- i have really enjoyed this cutter and especially like laser light and the fact that it locks shut when you lower the blade -- with grandchildren in the house now and then , this safety feature is very helpful . one of the dimensions must be 12 inches or less because the paper slips under the guide next to the cutting edge . so while i can not cut a 13 x 13 square , i can cut down tabloid or legal sized paper because it is only 11.5 inches wide . it is tricky though because you must be very careful to keep the top edge aligned perfectly with the back side of the cutter -- so if you hurry like i did the first time i tried , you may end up with a crooked cut . however , you still must have paper no wider than 12 inches . hope this helps -- i have really enjoyed this cutter and especially like laser light and ... » read more one of the dimensions must be 12 inches or less because the paper slips under the guide next to the cutting edge . so while i can not cut a 13 x 13 square , i can cut down tabloid or legal sized paper because it is only 11.5 inches wide . it is tricky though because you must be very careful to keep the top edge aligned perfectly with the back side of the cutter -- so if you hurry like i did the first time i tried , you may end up with a crooked cut . however , you still must have paper no wider than 12 inches . hope this helps -- i have really enjoyed this cutter and especially like laser light and the fact that it locks shut when you lower the blade -- with grandchildren in the house now and then , this safety feature is very helpful . « show less

no . i have cut thick almost cardboard like stock . it works well . the laser is a big help .
about 10 max , anymore and you will get skewed cuts . great trimmer !
i do not think it will work for that application . however i am not sure , i only use this with paper .
i do n't think this folds up . at least i ca n't see how it could .
there is a `` score blade '' included . is that what you are referring to ? this will make perforated lines . i hope this helps .
yes it does
the scoring is made from a dull blade that makes an indention in the card stock or paper . this makes it possible to create clean creases in cards .

sorry , but i do n't know . i used it in my hp fax machine , and it works fine .
i no longer have or use this item . my old printer used it . sorry i can not help you . les .
there is an opening in the back with a rack like fixture . dimensions about 1 x 4 inches ( height x width ) and throughout the bottom there is about half inch clearance .
3 1 2 inches
yes ... nothing keeps the drawer from being removed
the shortest side is 10.5 inches on the desk . the shelf above it is 11.75 inches . hope that helps .
i would have to say no . i utilize it to keep my laptop on top up to a size 17 '' and it sits well . i do use a keyboard but it does not fit under it .
no , the width of the opening under the stand is only ~13.25 '' wide .
no the space under the drawer would not be wide enough or deep enough to accommodate a standard keyboard . it is a nice and a sturdy piece of equipment though !
do n't know how much weight can hold , but is very sturdy . held a fairly heavy computer for me . should have no trouble at all holding a 23 inch lcd tv .
as it says in the description : 15 x 13.2 x 7.8 inches
for me , it does n't go under completely
both a standard dell keyboard and a larger ergonomic keyboard fit for me .
hello sandy , i have this item and it swivels up down left right . it 's a good buy . i really like it .
i use the mouse on the left side . the fellowes mouse tray is easily moved to the left side by removing the two screws , placing the tray on the left ( inverting the orientation so the attachment arm is now on the right side of the mouse tray ) , and fastening it with the same two screws in the pre-drilled , pre-threaded holes on the left side of the keyboard tray . the mouse tray works great on either the left or the right side . the fellowes engineers got this right !
the model number is ad-24 . it is a 14.4 watt switching adapter at 9 volts giving 1.6 amps . the plug uses positive outer conductor and is roughly 0.5 cm outer diameter and 3 mm inner . i think it 's fairly common adapter you may have around the house .
the machine will always waste a half inch on the left side because this is how much it needs to feed to get the previous label out . i think this is due to their cartridge design , so i expect that any machine using tz tape cartridges has this problem . but , if you look at your [ margin ] setting , you can choose `` full '' , `` half '' , `` narrow '' , or `` chain print '' . if you need to print multiple labels , use `` chain print '' and there will be nothing wasted between labels . chain print does not fully eject the label , so you need to hit `` feed '' when you 're done or the cutter will chop your last label in half . `` narrow '' is the best you can get for a single label , and just cut off the leading half inch . the machine will always waste a half inch on the left side because this is how much it needs to feed to get the previous label out . i think this is due to their cartridge design , so i expect that any machine using tz tape cartridges has this problem . but , if you look at your [ margin ] setting , you can choose `` full '' , `` half '' , `` narrow '' , or `` chain print '' . if you need to print multiple labels , use `` chain print '' and there will be nothing wasted between labels . chain print does not fully eject the label , so you need to hit `` feed '' when ... » read more the machine will always waste a half inch on the left side because this is how much it needs to feed to get the previous label out . i think this is due to their cartridge design , so i expect that any machine using tz tape cartridges has this problem . but , if you look at your [ margin ] setting , you can choose `` full '' , `` half '' , `` narrow '' , or `` chain print '' . if you need to print multiple labels , use `` chain print '' and there will be nothing wasted between labels . chain print does not fully eject the label , so you need to hit `` feed '' when you 're done or the cutter will chop your last label in half . `` narrow '' is the best you can get for a single label , and just cut off the leading half inch . « show less
i do n't know of any way to get around this `` feature '' . the machine appears to be programmed to stick the inch or so leader on the label . it appears to me that the manufacturer knew this was a issue because they print the two small dots at the point where the label has to be cut to center it . i wish i had a solution for you . good luck in finding one .

no caller id . this is your basic old fashion phone . no batteries or electrical outlets needed . we love it !
no digital displays . also no elect cord . just a single telephone line is needed .
assuming that you meant ringer equivalence number ( ren ) , i have no idea what that means . maybe if you could be more specific , i could answer the question .
on the first set i had ( that i returned ) the speakerphone was fine and static-free when the handset was n't , and it 's also fine on the 2nd ( properly working ) phone . have n't tried speaker volume , so ca n't comment on that ( and the phone 's not here ) . line powered .
i ca n't put my hands on the manual ( which came with the phone ) but those are definitely memory buttons . one of the buttons underneath m1 , m2 and m3 is a button labeled 'store ' . there is also memo , flash , pause , and redial .
no , no battery back-up .
not very long . i you want a longer one , you would have to purchase one.the phone is really nice though .
yes..both handset and wall to phone connections are included .
i did not need to plug into an electrical outlet .
yes , but you need to read the instructions and turn the tab over . if you do not change the tab , the phone receiver will fall off . i figured this out on my own and then read the directions .
i do not know .
it works for sure with the bases specified in the amazon display . i do n't know whether it works the same for the many other panasonic bases not specified in the amazon display .
do n't know . check with google
off the cradle about 1 week.batteries are aaa and last for years and replace easy .
yes
my tg1031 base unit came with 4 phones and i lost one of my handsets . i replaced the lost handset with another one and have had no problems . it works great .
hello , you have to register it to the main base ..press `` menu '' scroll up and down ... press `` initial settings '' select '' scroll up and down then press `` register '' select `` hs registration '' press the '' locator in the main base for 3 sec . until it beep then press `` ok '' in the handset ..
the base unit that i bought ( came with 3 phones : 1 at the base station , 2 phone-only stations ) does have a built-in answering machine . you can buy nearly the same system *without* an answering machine . the price difference was so little that we got ours with it . note that this listing is for the additional phone-only station -- requires a base station to work .
wall mounts ; not obtrusive ; is fine ...

my tga 101s model has speaker phones on all handsets and it 's good quality .
great ! thanks so very much ! i just changed the setting to manual . such a relief that i do n't have to send my phones back !
the panasonic phone system uses a standard 2.5-millimeter jack ( standard cordless phone size ) , while the iphone uses a 3.5mm jack . the larger size is much less common , though you could purchase an inexpensive 3.5mm to 2.5mm adapter , if interested .
yes , it does , however it does not tell you how many messages you have it just flashes .
from the manual : headset ( optional ) connecting a headset to the handsetallows hands-free phoneconversations . we recommend usingthe panasonic headset noted on page5 .

no ... .only the flashing display .
it is only 9 '' .
only the base is plugged into a phone jack .
i do n't know i have ase and 3 extra and it works great
yes it does . also , we have uverse and it includes voice mail and it includes mwi for that .
yes it does ... ... this is from the user manual . missed callsif a call is not answered , the unit treats it as amissed call . the display shows `` missedcall '' .note : even when there are unviewed missedcalls , `` missed call '' disappears from thestandby display if the following operation isperformed by one of the units : - a handset is replaced on the base unitor charger.- pressing [ off ] on a handset .
it was horrible and thrown away writhing weeks of purchase ! do not buy !
it appears to be .
24.5 inches floor to working surface of which one 7.5x 14 inches is fixed and the other tiltable 7.5x 16 inches
i returned this item because it was of such poor quality and so impossible to assemble .
yes it is adjustable but i do not rcomend this table i was very dissapionted very unstable , 2 screws stripped during assembly the split adjustable table top will not hold it 's position makig it hard to type etc .
i would not recommend this item . it was very tippy and could not be pushed far enough under the bed so that the tray was centered in bed . the assembly was not difficult , but the casters come off when it tips over . the two parts of the tray did not patch up after the first time if tip over . you will be better served to look around for a regular hospital tray assembly .
this has an edge about 3 8 '' high and a tilt table
yes the table top rotates both ways equally .
no , although mine came with a blank tile ... but only one . but you can make your own . i went to my local craft store and bought some magnetic tape . you can cut it any size you want to and it has an adhesive side . my son and i have a lot of fun finding small pictures in magazines ... or even on the computer . i cut them out , give it a coat of clear nail polish and stick a piece of magnetic tape on the back . for instance , if he has a play date , i 'll take a picture of his friend , reduce the playmate 's head shot on photoshop and make a magnet for the calendar . he loves seeing who 's house we are actually going to . no , although mine came with a blank tile ... but only one . but you can make your own . i went to my local craft store and bought some magnetic tape . you can cut it any size you want to and it has an adhesive side . my son and i have a lot of fun finding small pictures in magazines ... or even on the computer . i cut them out , give it a coat of clear nail polish and stick a piece of magnetic tape on the back . for instance , if he has a play date , i 'll take a picture of his friend , reduce the playmate 's head shot on photoshop and make a magnet for the calendar . he loves seeing who 's house we are ... » read more no , although mine came with a blank tile ... but only one . but you can make your own . i went to my local craft store and bought some magnetic tape . you can cut it any size you want to and it has an adhesive side . my son and i have a lot of fun finding small pictures in magazines ... or even on the computer . i cut them out , give it a coat of clear nail polish and stick a piece of magnetic tape on the back . for instance , if he has a play date , i 'll take a picture of his friend , reduce the playmate 's head shot on photoshop and make a magnet for the calendar . he loves seeing who 's house we are actually going to . « show less
our set went from 2013 - 2017
2013-2017
i have 2013 & 2014 calendar bought in dec 2012
yes .
ours was not . that said , i assume new magnets come out with this every now and then . ours was for 2013-2017
yes , they sure do !
i did not know the ink cartridges have an expiration date .
december 2015
on my package it says january of 2014. radion8lu
i have no idea ... ... ... ..ask hp
i have not . not sure how it could be done even if i wanted to .
no
only exactly 12 '' ... sorry
yes , it comes in a flat box and must be totally assembled but it is not too difficult . overall we are happy with the product .
the width ( front ) is 15.5 and the depth is 19.5
yes . the drawers open fully . just do n't open both drawers at the same time or the cabinet will tip .
the drawers are 16 and 3 8 inches deep . doug copeland
judging from the images they are the same . one website lists the 016 as the `` standard color '' while the 026 is the black color
the ergo rest is very adjustable . i believe it can accommodate a wide range of arm-lengths . i use it with my wacom tablets , however , i imagine it could support any sort of mouse or keyboard use . it attaches to a table or desk , so the height or adjust-ability of your chair is key . i hope this answer helps .
if you are meaning your desk is 1 foot thick on the deck then the answer is no
only 1 ( but worth getting 2 ! )
sits flush with desk level , does n't go lower at all.can go 2-3 inches higher than desk level with the locking screw at the bottom .
the center of the armrest 'cup ' can only extend about 5 inches over the edge of the desk . it 's plenty for elbow movement when using a mouse or keyboard within 12 '' of front edge of desk .
no . but you would n't want to . i 've been using this device for over 6 years , and it 's the movement that makes it so comfortable , practical , and invaluable to the ergonomic health of your arms and shoulders .
i do n't know that width is part of the formula . they clamp to a desktop up to 1 1 4 '' thick . they swing in an 11 1 2 '' arc . hope that helps .
if you lower the arm rest all the way , on the one i have , the bottom of the padded , cushioned , trough like surface , is about 1 8 inch higher than the desk top . when your forearm presses down on the cushioned padding it will be just about exactly at the same level as the desk top . this is the lowest adjustment . you can only go higher from there .
yes ! it provides amazing forearm support !
no . ink cost more than machine , and postage to return did too so i trashed it .
you can look up the cartridge number . the cartridges cost about $ 35 .
came without ink and ink cost more than fax so i trashed it .
not as far as i 'm aware . it connects via a usb cable .
i just fed over 120 fabrication tickets through this scanner in no time at all . lightning fast feed and no jams . the paper is about the thickness of a post card . no problems at all .
i do n't think you will have any problem as long as you cut the pages so that glue and debris does not contaminate the scanner .
i had the same question , and found this link : http : www.fuzeqna.com fujitsu_support consumer kbdetail.asp ? kbid=15it looks like it is compatible , as it is pdf based , and can be linked with paperport per the information provided in the link i just found . good luck ...

i am no techie ... but in using text to voice software in a special education classroom my understanding is that a twain driver is necessary . we use the kurzweil software . if the books you want to read are available in digital format there are several online services which make the conversion , readplease or perhaps pleaseread.com is an example . good luck in achieving your goal .
call the company that makes the product , they sell replacement wheels . they actually gave me 1 or 2 for free the 1st time i called . i had to purchase a set of 5 last time .
it 's vinyl . but do yourself a favor . this chair is junk with a capital j. do n't buy it unless you want the hassle of throwing it in the garbage within a few months . crap , junk , garbage , ripoff , trash , broken , etc .
its real but you will have to put new wheels on , they break in the 1st week because the chair is heavy and the wheels are plastic but a really nice chair , all my clients love it , it makes me feel like i 'm worth a billion $ $ $
i weight 200 and it broke the 1st month , had to get new wheels on it , comes with plastic wheels . got metal wheels on it and it 's fine . but i do have to say clients are impressed by it and it is comfortable . i 've had it 3 years and it 's held up well .
16 '' from floor to bottom of the seat cushion .
yes , this chair should work at a conference room table ( we use ours at a computer desk ) . it does n't have wheels on the legs though ( if that matters to you ) .
19 inches from the ground to the top of the seat cushion . keep in mind you only have 5-7 inches of cushion before the arm rests will interfere with that height if you are planning on them sliding under the table .
no
no wheels . i suppose you might be able to put casters on , but the feet are an oblong shaped solid metal . if done , i do n't think it would be that easy but that is just a guess . i ca n't tell if the bottom is solid or hollow so do n't know how secure you could attach anything .
no . but there are only 6 pieces plus 8 screws . extremely easy to assemble . took me more time to take it out of the package than it did to put it together . maybe 15 minutes from start to finish ... maybe !
yes
i do n't know for sure as i do n't have wooden floors to test it , but the legs do have rubber ends , so i would think not.edit : they are plastic , not rubber . i do n't see it making a difference , though .
to the top of the arm rest is 25 ''
if it gets too hot or you have done too many lamination 's , it will not allow you to do another lamination . full turn off , i am not sure as when i am complete with what i need to do i physically turn it off and unplug it .
this equipment uses a regular 110 power outlet . as far as demand of use , it has performed quite well for us . we make more than 1,000 laminated badges per year and this product has worked perfectly for us . we have not experienced any problems whatsoever . i would recommend it to anyone who would is looking for a laminator . small , compact and very easy to use .
there is a practical limit on how thick a pouch can be run through the unit and still be heated properly , but i actually bought this to run circuit boards through and they are 0.060 in , or about 15 pieces of copying paper thick . i doubt you would have a problem with any combo of pouch badge .
you only get the plastic lamination pouches . you need to buy seperate blank cards from avery , etc . to make on your pc
yes , we offer a template for these on our website . it is downloadable for free and works with microsoft word . it can be found under the templates section under the heading labels . if amazon allows this , here is a link to the templates page on our website - http : www.desktopsupplies.com templates.html
i bought them to use with my embosser and they worked better than the one 's that originally came with it ! the only drawback is that you have to cut out the center 6 disks in order be able to reach them to emboss . but that is simple enough .
there is a slight chance they are mislabeled , but more than likely office max will not print on them because we are n't a well known brand unfortunately . did they run any through their printers yet ? or did they simply look at it and say it was n't compatible ? either way , if you want to private message us , i would be glad to work with you to get it resolved- whether it be that we send another package out to you that we verified are laser printer compatible or we get you a refund . so when you get a chance , please message us !
i use it with windows 7 .
do n't know - i 'm an imac user
yes it does .
no
if you have a disc drive it should work . i 'm running on an imac with separate drive unit .

each box is approximately 3in x 3in
no , the pieces are not magnetic . good idea . i use push points but now that you mention magnetic maybe small pieces of velcro might help keep the calendar in good shape .
the photo is really small , so i am guessing ... no it does n't look like it has ink in it .
it 's a screw on cap .
no -- this pen has its own built-in piston filling system . really easy to use -- you just dip the tip in a bottle of good ink ( pelikan ink recommended ) , turn the barrel section fully in one direction to empty flush and in the other direction to suck in fill .

you will have to bend down a bit ... .the top of the board is at 66 '' when on the wheels .
our package contained tools , including a wrench , but i needed a small adjustable wrench to hold the backside of one set of the fasteners while tightening .
we use a dry-erase eraser to erase , but use the spray once in a while to make it look like new . the kids use the board daily .
not sure , but it 's a great board.. i use it every day @ my company for our meetings and its easy to use n love the 2 sided ability.. great price , good product..
great price ! we love this board , use it daily ( homeschool ) , it is sturdy , cleans easily and is magnetic .
stays on .

no this machine does not have a dust cover . other than that , it is a very nice adding machine , and it has a manual that is more or less helpful . i used it during tax season 2013 , and it worked perfectly . i would definitely buy it again .
for my classroom purposes , it 's fine . my warnings , however , are that the board may be too high up for a three year old . also , the surface of the board is a bit delicate . get water , juice , even the oils from your fingers on it , and you will have problems getting it completely clean . i guess my answer is `` look elsewhere '' .
maybe about 5 lbs ?
no , it is attached to the front legs . however , the legs do telescope down so you can place the board on a table or desk top . we have had our for a couple of years now , and it has held up well in an office setting .
wipes off completely with the use of expo dry erase markers and eraser . quality markers plus quality board equal overall quality product use after use .
no it is not magnetic .
no
it can hold the large pad of paper , almost poster size . there is a metal bar that runs across the top which has two tightening nuts ( one on each side ) which you can loosen , slide the pad up underneath the bar , and then re-tighten to hold the pad in place .
no . it 's very lightweight . i made that mistake !
screw not adhesive . i have four of these in my home . work great !
a stiff breeze will delatch it , so a toddler definitely yes ... if that is his her intention
i guess it would depend on what material your office door is made of ( i.e . solid wood metal ) . i have it on interior doors at home and the magnet is pretty strong . if you have a very heavy door it may hold but allow easy release if bumped . so far i have been happy with the product .
like everything , made in china .
no . it is a date stamp . you ca n't make it say whatever you want .
no . you must choose one of the phrases .
2012-2023
everything is plastic , everything ... except the base plate ( the one it sits on and what would touch the paper ) that being said it feels extremely solid , it is just lighter than the ones that have metal on them . i would buy it again .
yes !
yes it does , although i would recommend the newer version , kx-tg6533b , or even better still the kx-tg6643b or the kx-tg6843b ( current version ) ( all have a keypad on the base station for making calls without the handset -very handy ! ) and they all have displays with larger characters that are much easier to read . the 6643b also has a feature where if your power goes out , you can reverse one of the handsets in the base station charging cradle and run the phone answering system off of the handset battery power until the lights come back on .
no power equals no phone !
they charge each phone in each cradle so yes all cradles also are chargers
not that i 'm aware of !
you can print on both sides of the card . you just need a printer that can do double sided printing or work out how to turn the card over and get the printing aligned . a couple of trial runs should fix that problemregardsalex
it is a very clean edge . rather than ripping the excess edge off if you bend the card back and forth a few times at the seam edge the tent card border just pops off .
if you have software that allows you to merge , you should be able to do all 150 .
you have to go to avery website . insert your template number . do you work on it and print from there . you can make an account to keep your worked saved .
the avery template for these allows you to print on both sides . i remember using the template without too much difficulty .
yes
hi mara , yes you can write on avery labels with ballpoint pen and ink without smudging . ( ink such as `` unipen waterproof ink pen '' ) regardsalex
as far as i know all canon pp-201 paper has the same weight .
i do n't see why you could n't , just be aware of the paper sizes your printer will and wo n't allow . i think brands of paper are cross compatible though . i use hp paper on my canon printer all the time
the paper is physically 4x6 . if you print borderless prints they will be that size . if you want larger prints you will need 5x7 paper or larger paper .
if you are asking if this paper is good quality , the answer is yes . i find it the best for my photos . i use the canon pixma 6220 and 6500. the paper is 4x6 . not sure if you are purchasing paper or a printer ? i am unfamiliar with the selphy .
canon says ii is an improvement to the paper providing more vivid colors than before . try it you 'll like it !
hi larry , sorry i ca n't answer your question because i purchased these for use in my canon ink jet printer .
it 's perfect
if you mean can you print images on both sides the answer is no .
blank
i got this for my wife to carry her ipad and a lined notepad for meetings at work . i 'm not sure how thick the mac book is but i would think it would fit . there is a lot of room inside it . plenty of room for the ipad and the note pad , plus a calculator and pens and pencils . hope this helps .
hi , good question . the answer is that it depends on how much stuff you 're carrying in the left-side folder pockets . with nothing in it , or just a few papers discs business cards in it , the depth is slightly over an inch . fill the folder pockets , include a loose magazine , and with a full pad of paper and you 'll be looking at slightly over 2 '' . big picture , i really do n't see this item as being a pack mule ; rather , it 's like an elegant portable writing station . hope this helps : )
the padfolio comes with , and is designed for a4 paper which opens to the top . that is , paper that is bound at , and tears away from the top . technically , you could use any size paper pads ( read : letter size ) , as long as the width is 8.5 '' . hope this helps
yes .
yes , it is a genuine hp . i 've tried the `` clones '' without success , but this one was a genuine hp .
this is compatible to your printer according to the hp website , http : h10025.www1.hp.com ewfrf wc document ? docname=c01574181 &tmp; _track_link=ot_faqs top_issues en_us c01574181 loc:6 &cc; =us &dlc; =en &lc; =en &product; =3692888 # n383 .
yes it does and you will be glad you went with the xl .
i have n't used the entire cartridge yet . i initially got some 'sales help ' but i just looked it up online . the 901 says 200 page yield but the 901 xl says 700 page yield . so it 's basically letting you know that it is the better deal .
i only buy one , 901xl , it has one . i do n't know what do you mean with cc654an # 140
that 's a reasonable question for the selling vendor , but amazon forwarded it to other customers to answer ! since i bought mine months ago , i doubt that the expiration date on my box will help you . in my experience , the shelf life of these is near infinite before the seal is taken off ; they dry out or get gunked up if they sit in the printer too long after having been opened - that happened to me once on a color cartridge when i was printing mostly black .
on the box it lists 4500
expiration is september 2015 - i will have this one used by march now that it 's tax time .
i do not have a c4600 . i have a c4795 . however 4ink jet & ld printer supply both day that hp 60 tri-color original ink does work .
a standard cartridge will generally print 200 copies . but , this is based on how much color you expect to put to each page . you should expect much less yield if you or your kids are printing full page color or photo dense copies . btw - the xl versions are generally a better deal as they print 600 for a slight increase in cost . shop out the cartridges on-line .
the cartridge i received was a legit genuine , brand new , hp brand ink cartridge .
i have no idea . i use hp 60 and they always work well in my printer .
it is engraved on the cartridge
i have no idea , sorry . i suggest you do a web search .
the refill is the standard cross refill medium point black # 0405
mine came with medium black but if you do n't like the color or the tip you can always buy a refill ... they use standard cross refills ...
great question , unfortunately i do not have an answer for you but the best course of action would be to visit a stationary super store and check out the cross refills available . i too prefer the gel ink good luck
as everything else in this world ... ..china..but the quality is excellent ... and the pen writes beautiful . i have had it over a year and have received complimentsand it has never ever failed me ... re-filled it twice . no problems at all ... you ca n't go wrong ... .

all my pilot pens seem standard so you can try it .
it is called an agitator and it helps keep the ink from sticking in the top of the chamber . some people take them out ( i do n't ) - but it will freely move back and forth if there is no ink inside .
it is already the best of the pilot converters , which pen do you have
some pen forums indicate that it works with either the con-20 or con-50 although if the pen came with a converter it was neither of those but rather one that 's similar to the con-20 that only shipped , as far as i 'm aware , with the pilot 78g . i second camille 's advice to check with goulet pens , brian has a ton of information on his site & their customer service answers questions like yours all the time .
as i understand , the con-50 can be used in any namiki pilot pen that accepts namiki pilot cartridges . i use the con-50 in a namiki falcon and a pilot prera . as a rule , i prefer converters over cartridges for the ability to use whatever bottled ink you wish . personally , i have never used pilot cartridges , my preference being diamine and waterman inks .
yes . this will fit a metropolitan . i use it in a prera but have both pens . it fits in the same space as their ink cartridge .
here 's a google link that says yes : https : www.google.com search ? q=pilot+fountain+pen+converter+ ( con-50 ) for+plumix &oq; =pilot+fountain+pen+converter+ ( con-50 ) for+plumix &aqs; =chrome..69i57.2055j0j4 &source; id=chrome &es; _sm=91 &ie; =utf-8
yes you can use either one for the lexmark higher resolution with the 16 26. but i do n't really see a difference
hi shannon yes these cartridges will work in the x1240 . you might want to note that it is vary rare to actually receive the `` gold '' brand which is really quite good when buying on here .

yes . i ought a refill at staples and it fits .
i have not had a problem with the call waiting . it is a separate function from the phone company that i purchased to allow the number to be shown .
my opinion is no . i have n't been looking or pricing for a while but i miss features that my panasonic had . like being able to listen to a message while using the phone . i also had a hard time connecting a new handset to the base . it still is hit or miss with the address book and caller id . it also only holds 50 contacts not enough for me . this is n't feature rich .

a mid tower case will fit - about 22 inches
no ... it fix mounts under the desk . i had flipped it over to extend out the front , but it 's so low to the legs , that sitting that far out from the desk made it an obstacle so i put it back on per instructions . i used an imac on it so the keyboard worked out for me on the desk surface , but have since purchased the desk i originally wanted , so i use this primarily as a laptop desk in another room . honestly , it 's a cheap `` get something now '' desk that served its purpose . but i was happy to get my setup on my new desk . hope that helps .

i use the montblanc ink in this pen most of the time . i have many montblanc pens and some others - some very expensive and i really do find that when using a fountain pen , i actually do prefer montblanc over other inks . it really also depends on the nib and the paper . the montblanc ink is fairly wet but not as wet as the pilot iroshizuku ink though which is very good but only on very high quality paper . those two inks are best for me with this pen . i hate to say it but the color matters as well . when i am using black , i prefer writing with the montblanc ink but the pilot blue is really a special looking ink and if you are going for blue , i would not use a ef nib cause it will be very wet . those are my recommendations and i hope it helps . i use the montblanc ink in this pen most of the time . i have many montblanc pens and some others - some very expensive and i really do find that when using a fountain pen , i actually do prefer montblanc over other inks . it really also depends on the nib and the paper . the montblanc ink is fairly wet but not as wet as the pilot iroshizuku ink though which is very good but only on very high quality paper . those two inks are best for me with this pen . i hate to say it but the color matters as well . when i am using black , i prefer writing with the montblanc ink but the pilot blue is really a ... » read more i use the montblanc ink in this pen most of the time . i have many montblanc pens and some others - some very expensive and i really do find that when using a fountain pen , i actually do prefer montblanc over other inks . it really also depends on the nib and the paper . the montblanc ink is fairly wet but not as wet as the pilot iroshizuku ink though which is very good but only on very high quality paper . those two inks are best for me with this pen . i hate to say it but the color matters as well . when i am using black , i prefer writing with the montblanc ink but the pilot blue is really a special looking ink and if you are going for blue , i would not use a ef nib cause it will be very wet . those are my recommendations and i hope it helps . « show less

i just tried taking out the cartridge to print a photo and the printer does n't appear to work without a cartridge in the slot . so i do n't think it will work without the cartridge .
it is n't clear if you want the photo ink or just the ink cartridge , nor do i know if you have the all-in-one printer or not . try here or email hp directly : http : www.ebay.com sch i.html ? _nkw=ink+cartridges+hp+b210e jm

having the same machine , i have never had a problem . check that the cartridge is not defective and that you have correctly inserted it in the right slot .
while i have themagenta for my office jet # 4620 , i 'm really not that happy with the cartridge . reds come out magenta and do n't print very dark . not sure about it fitting into your photosmart . suggest you contact hp .
the hp7520 needs a `` special '' black photo cartridge to print photos because using everyday ink will not be enough to print as many as 1 photo before drying up . especially when printing 8.5 in x 11 or a few 4x6 on a single glossy paper before having to go out and replace the everyday ink .
no do n't use it

yes it can i have a pavilion g6 and it 's perfect . my screens size is 15.6 and it 's great i like it because i can adjust the height i also like it because it has a built-in mouse pad .
it 's flat on the sides so you can use any size laptop . it may be larger than the thingamajig it rests on but it will still work fine . i have a 17 inch and have no problems .
no . when legs are fully-extended , top is only 14 inches high .
no - this version is the table only .
definitely tall enough . plenty of adjustment options .
as a lady with thick thighs myself , it works well enough for me . the opening is roughly 18x8 for the legs . i have no problems with it . sadly , it 's not adjustable in this area . i wish it was . but over ally , it 's a very good product .
no , they fold under , can be used as lap board or fold legs out and then fold extension to increase length of legs .
yes - holds a full strip of staples and yes , they are standard size .

i do not know . i have always used canon printers , ink and paper . read on the back of the canon paper and see if it is compatible to the hp printer . or ask the associates at best buy or staples for their opinion .
nope , tried it once , ink smears - do n't know about a felt pen though , but inkjet ink will not work .
with canon pro platinum paper there is the word canon printed diagonally across the back of the paper at 43mm centres and the back is dull and the front ( printing side ) is brilliantly glossy . at least that 's how their the letter sized paper is presented .
it 's glossy . definitely glossy . and super sharp and clear . i love this paper .

i 've gotten cartidges from `` enviroinks '' with mixed success . they are very inexpensive but about 1 of 3 to 1 of 4 gets rejected by the printer .
i can answer the part about double sided printing , having fallen into the trap . built in means you print one side and then manually feed the paper through to print side two . i ca n't answer to the envelope and label question.i am pretty steamed about the built in part though . that is why i bought this printer . i thought it meant automatic double sided printing .
the keyboard trays that screw on are the best . the very first time i installed this tray it worked great . i had to move it ( that 's why i did n't want the screw on keyboard ) . since i 've moved it the tray becomes loose and i ca n't tighten it completely . the nuts are plastic and i will have to replace them - that might solve my problem . for the money it is a good product . i do n't feel this tray was intended for heavy use like a work environment .
i believe it 's just the front .
approximately 28 1 4 '' wide by 14 '' deep by about 2 '' high for the tray . including the mounting clamps requires about 34 '' in width .
clamp to clamp is 33-1 2 '' distance between outer edges of tray is 28-3 8 '' interior of tray is 25-3 4 '' acrossmouse pad is 6-5 8 '' widekeyboard area is 19-1 4 '' wide .
from what i can tell is that it is clamps only . i 'd love to use the tray to but with all the hardware angles it is basically clamp . if you are handy you might come up with something but i have n't .
it would have to be a large backpack .
it 's best to have at least 14. the main thing you need is at least 32 '' clear space so that the tray along with the hardware to be able to use the system . it 's a great product but only if you have the room to set it up .
i do n't think so . the clamps on either side of the keyboard need a flat surface to attach to . i had a bar under my desk and it would not work for me because of that .
there 's instructions on the permanent piece of pvc that your graphic adheres to . assembly is simple and takes about 5 minutes to set up .

make sure you are using the lever to make it retract . mine stopped retracting and i had to send it back . the send it back it me in two weeks and it 's working now .
yes it would fit , but you would have the 2 inches of bar showing at the top .
yes ... if you only wanted to show part of the banner , you could just raise the bar as far as you needed to and lock it in .
hi scott . the pen comes with a converter . to fill it , you submerge the nib into an ink bottle and twist the knob on the top of the converter . the pen is also cartridge compatible if you 'd rather use cartridges instead . i like bottle ink because there are so many more choices available .
since the nibs on all fountain pens are symmetrical , i ca n't think of any reason why it would make a difference whether you are right- or left- handed .
as far as i know , the cartridges are no longer beeing made so with luck , ebay might be the place . i use the charge pump on the pen . at times it might get messy , but i allways have a full pen . hope it helped .
it comes with a standard medium nib , which in my opinion is a little bold . but you can easily replace it with a fine tip if you wanted .
it came with a blue-black cartridge if i remember . it rights well . it is a medium to broad nib . i like the pen , though . it feels heavy in the hand , which makes it look and feel like a much more expensive pen .
it comes with a converter , so you can whatever ink you choose . in other words , it uses bottled ink , not cartridges ; so , you 're not limited .
i seriously doubt it given the price of this pen . only the nib is marked as 18k gold plate . i will say that the rest of the `` gold '' on the pen is still looking wearing well after a year 's use and i do live near the ocean so if the `` gold '' embellishments on the barrel and cap were mere brass i 'd expect some tarnish but they could just be very well lacquered ... i 'd also add that i 'm not having the problem that mr. blevins mentions . i used my pen after not using it for over a week with no problems .

it is currently hanging on the wall horizontally , but if we recall correctly , it did have haning hardware on the back to allow either direction .

towards the front ( where it opens ) it is 1 1 4 inch . towards the back it is a little over 1 1 2 inch . sounds small but surprisingly not . husband can fit a 3 subject notebook and some loose papers in there . hope this helps .
which part of this lap tray are you putting onto the other lap tray ? this lap tray does already have a cushion underneath and would work quite well for a young girl in one piece without needing to make any alterations to it 's design
yes , the surface area is more than large enough to support either while lying flat . however , it would not be ideal as a stand for either .

i used this to store 11 x 17 paper , sliding paper into slots `` landscape '' oriented . slots are 18 '' wide , l to r .
16-3 4 '' high , 18-5 8 '' deep , and 26-15 16 '' wide . i just measured mine .
yes , it fits nicely .
yes
it 's sturdy , but full of paper i do n't think it would stack very well . the dividers are cardboard as well .
i 'm using it with 8.1 and it works fine .
you have turned the label printer on ? it needs it 's own batteries or power adapter to work , the usb cable is just for communication not power , there is a switch on the machine just neder the usb socket , marked 'e ' and 'el ' , in one position it allows the machine to send the simple software to the computer so it will work with out installing anything , in the other position you need to start up the label printer software manually , so try both switch positions , turning the machine off and back on after changing the switch position .
i do n't know how well they will perform out of doors but they seem to last forever indoors . give it a try.jwl
not sure if there is a way . i have another brother printer that has an auto cut , on that model you can change a setting , but on this one you pretty much have to waste some of the label . one option is to make one larger label with smaller ones and cut them after they all have printed . but , that only works if you are printing many at the same time .
andrea - i have been using it with windows 7 for quite some time . i have to say , however , that brother 's software is ugly , klutzy , and ultimately wastes too much material . it should be significantly easier to use , but i do n't find it so .
it should work with any kind of cartridge . in general you make an hole in the original cartridge through which you push the ink via siringe .
yes it is . i have been using this ink refill kit for both hp 60 and hp 61 with no issues what-so-ever . the ink is the exact same color and it does n't clog the nozzle head .
ink has nothing to do with the brand of the printers , unless you specifically need ink for photo or other special use
it should be . my best advice is search youtube for `` refililling hp 564 cartridges '' and watch the video . if they 're refillied via a small hole on top , then yes , this kit will work great . i 've already refilled my 21 & 22 cartridges 3-4 times & have tons of ink left .
yes and it works well

i use it on my rx680 i 've had the ink for a long time . if you do n't print a lot you will have to clean the print heads often . otherwise the ink is just as good as the real stuff . it is also messy when refilling wear protective gloves and have a lot of paper towels handy . a good buy for the price also easy to install .
did not work - trashed my printer . i 'd avoid it .
yes . it has a reset button , so when your printer thinks its out of ink , you press the reset button and then it shows 100 % i think you hold the button while powering on . i ca n't remember . the seller has videos on youtube for install and troubleshooting . i 've emailed them ( ask seller a question thru amazon ) and they 've always responded quickly . i would n't hesitate to purchase anything from hotzone360 . beware of others selling the `` same '' product under hotzone 's listing . btw . as in the video on youtube . be very gentle when holding the reset button . it 's mounted on a circuit board and the board can snap if too much pressure is put on it . not a design flaw , just the nature of circuit boards . watch the video . it 's very straight forward . sorry i do n't have the links on my iphone . next time i 'm i 'm my desktop ( if ever ) ill post them . again . contact hotzone and they 'll answer all questions . i remembered their name , and its been well over a year or two since i bought . so that should tell you something . yes . it has a reset button , so when your printer thinks its out of ink , you press the reset button and then it shows 100 % i think you hold the button while powering on . i ca n't remember . the seller has videos on youtube for install and troubleshooting . i 've emailed them ( ask seller a question thru amazon ) and they 've always responded quickly . i would n't hesitate to purchase anything from hotzone360 . beware of others selling the `` same '' product under hotzone 's listing . btw . as in the video on youtube . be very gentle when holding the reset button . it 's mounted ... » read more yes . it has a reset button , so when your printer thinks its out of ink , you press the reset button and then it shows 100 % i think you hold the button while powering on . i ca n't remember . the seller has videos on youtube for install and troubleshooting . i 've emailed them ( ask seller a question thru amazon ) and they 've always responded quickly . i would n't hesitate to purchase anything from hotzone360 . beware of others selling the `` same '' product under hotzone 's listing . btw . as in the video on youtube . be very gentle when holding the reset button . it 's mounted on a circuit board and the board can snap if too much pressure is put on it . not a design flaw , just the nature of circuit boards . watch the video . it 's very straight forward . sorry i do n't have the links on my iphone . next time i 'm i 'm my desktop ( if ever ) ill post them . again . contact hotzone and they 'll answer all questions . i remembered their name , and its been well over a year or two since i bought . so that should tell you something . « show less
yes . quite impressive . just do n't push it too hard .
about 8 '' tall by 4 '' diameter ( not round , more oblong )
it 's got some adjustment , but limited . i would say `` standard '' size only .
if you hold in the shavings receptacle the sharpener works fine .
it is plug in and i love it
i do n't believe it does . the electrical cord is for standard 120v ac .
yes it will work in uk .
it does not have a hold button .
just an fyi - another responder mentioned the bells beneath the base , but those bells are for decoration and ring only when you use the crank on the side - it has nothing to do with the actual ring when someone calls . when someone calls , the ringer sounds like any other corded phone . it is not antique sounding .
the phone 's dimensions are about 28cm high , 24cm wide , and 18cm deep at its largest ( although the cord sticks out a little bit wider ) .
yes there were 6 colors and the colors shown . maybe the orange is slightly different .
colors were evenly distributed

i drilled a hole straight through the top ( there is a small indent on the top of these so figured that was as good a place as any ) and squirted in about 5ml of ink . put it back in the printer and unfortunately it still showed empty ink cartridge , so it must be using it 's hp technology that we need a special device to reset the cartridge to be full again . however i did n't leave it in the printer long enough to test it to see if the ink would come out on the page or not , so still wondering how to properly refill these.i wish i had cut the top off with my dremel tool i thought about this , but not until after i had already thrown away the old cartridge . this new cartridge is one of the xl cartridges so i will surely cut the top off if nobody has come up with instructions by then to see how to refill it if it 's even possible which i hope it is , else we 've pretty much throwin away thousands of dollars buying the whole office filled with these printers , but we wanted to switch them all over to the xl cartridges and then refill those since they should hold at least 2x the ink quantity based just on their size alone . so once the first xl cartridge dries up on one of these printers , i 'll cut the top off and have a look inside . i drilled a hole straight through the top ( there is a small indent on the top of these so figured that was as good a place as any ) and squirted in about 5ml of ink . put it back in the printer and unfortunately it still showed empty ink cartridge , so it must be using it 's hp technology that we need a special device to reset the cartridge to be full again . however i did n't leave it in the printer long enough to test it to see if the ink would come out on the page or not , so still wondering how to properly refill these.i wish i had cut the top off with my dremel tool i thought ... » read more i drilled a hole straight through the top ( there is a small indent on the top of these so figured that was as good a place as any ) and squirted in about 5ml of ink . put it back in the printer and unfortunately it still showed empty ink cartridge , so it must be using it 's hp technology that we need a special device to reset the cartridge to be full again . however i did n't leave it in the printer long enough to test it to see if the ink would come out on the page or not , so still wondering how to properly refill these.i wish i had cut the top off with my dremel tool i thought about this , but not until after i had already thrown away the old cartridge . this new cartridge is one of the xl cartridges so i will surely cut the top off if nobody has come up with instructions by then to see how to refill it if it 's even possible which i hope it is , else we 've pretty much throwin away thousands of dollars buying the whole office filled with these printers , but we wanted to switch them all over to the xl cartridges and then refill those since they should hold at least 2x the ink quantity based just on their size alone . so once the first xl cartridge dries up on one of these printers , i 'll cut the top off and have a look inside . « show less

no they are all standard needles
answer here ... it always stick out side .
the case they come in just says `` standard plastic base tagging needles '' made in china .
they are clear plastic tags .
if it states 2 inch then that is what you will get .
it 's been a long time since i bought it , but i do n't recall any replacement needles .
i guess it would if it works . i could n't get mine to work , so i really do n't know.the plastic fasteners seem long enough to be able to attach 2 pr . of socks.good luck !
no , you need to purchase the tags you want . it does come with the plastic tabs that attach the tags to the clothing .
i have had no problems with them .
the ones i ordered are great .
when i use ebay , i tell it to print `` without instructions ( two labels per page ) '' . it is chosen with a check box .
in my opinion they stick great .
each sheet has two labels .
it 's 200 labels total
there are two separate shipping labels on each sheet and each independently easily peel off the backing . in fact , if i only print one label i save the other one and print on it later . they feed very well through my printer and adhere permanently to the envelope package . i love them . makes all my shipping look professional .
mr. stevens : the labels i purchased were sold by 975 supply and they worked great . i had no problems with them at all .
yes exactly two labels of 5 1 2 each makes it an 11 inch long and a 8 1 2 inch wide paper
yes , the priority mail envelopes that you 're referring to are what i use the majority of the time . i 've never had an issue with the labels not sticking , even when i have an irregularly shaped item in the envelope .
it will work for the trading card pages ( 3 x 3 slots , 18 cards per page ) . i 'm not entirely sure if it will work for the photo album pages.hopes it helps , any further questions do n't hesitate to ask.riaz ali khan

can this phone be used with verizon as the service provider ?
lynnh answered the question . i have this phone and reset the access code after i got it and have used this feature exactly the same way lynnh sez .
the base unit hs a power adapter . the phone has a battery .
a blinking light , but it 's bright and noticeable and calls can be screened if you 're home . you can clearly hear the caller leaving a message and there 's plenty of time to pick up the call before they hang up .
no , it is not .
have no idea what the question is so therefore can not respond to this statement .

hi ! retail packaging is the kind of packaging you are going to find if you go into a store and buy a product . when someone on-line says `` retail packaging , '' you can be quite sure it 's the real deal and not some knock-off product posing as the real deal . buying ink on-line can be a tricky business because so many vendors deal in third party manufactures -- people who make the ink to fit certain printers . if they say `` retail packaging '' and show you a picture , you can be quite sure it 's what is sold in the stores .
it is very easy . but before replacing the drum , be sure to have tried cleaning the inside of the printer as well as the drum roller , by following brother printer instructions ( can be found on website ) . also , there is a place inside the printer above the drum area , that is a little rectangular glass area that you should try to clean first . there might be toner splatter up there that might be disfiguring your printed pages . i try to do a good cleaning prior to giving up on the drum . but , alas , i have replaced drums because i really like the printer and want to keep using it . the only mess is clean up , the drum itself just requires to be replaced . there are also instructions in informing the printer itself that it is having its drum replaced . i found brothers website very useful to research prior to actually changing out the drums . very detailed instructions suggestions . it is very easy . but before replacing the drum , be sure to have tried cleaning the inside of the printer as well as the drum roller , by following brother printer instructions ( can be found on website ) . also , there is a place inside the printer above the drum area , that is a little rectangular glass area that you should try to clean first . there might be toner splatter up there that might be disfiguring your printed pages . i try to do a good cleaning prior to giving up on the drum . but , alas , i have replaced drums because i really like the printer and want to keep using it . the only mess is ... » read more it is very easy . but before replacing the drum , be sure to have tried cleaning the inside of the printer as well as the drum roller , by following brother printer instructions ( can be found on website ) . also , there is a place inside the printer above the drum area , that is a little rectangular glass area that you should try to clean first . there might be toner splatter up there that might be disfiguring your printed pages . i try to do a good cleaning prior to giving up on the drum . but , alas , i have replaced drums because i really like the printer and want to keep using it . the only mess is clean up , the drum itself just requires to be replaced . there are also instructions in informing the printer itself that it is having its drum replaced . i found brothers website very useful to research prior to actually changing out the drums . very detailed instructions suggestions . « show less
if i recall correctly , it is . it has worked well for me .
yes
what i have found is if it says `` compatible '' it means it is a refill or refurb . i have been bitten by items that only say `` brother '' that ended up being compatibles that were n't all that compatible . you might have to dig down into the sellers site a bit to find out if it is a refill or not . i have had to do that . the particular unit that this link took me to looks like it is an original brother item .
i 'm not entirely sure , but it is thousands . i think the website for brother tells how many you can expect . there are two cartridges , one is a regular one and the other is high yield . i get the high yield one . you can find the numbers at brother 's site .
that 's the printer i put it in.works great shelly
yes
it certainly is not airtight , but i do n't think it has enough ventilation to put a computer inside the lockable compartment and run it for an extended period of time . there are a few decent sized holes for cords to run in and out of , but no real `` vent. ``
yes
i do n't think so . it 's not very deep .
if you set the vertical arms supporting the top of the cart to the highest point , you will have 13 '' clearance from the top of the cabinet to the underside of the pull out tray .
they have the wrong dimensions listed on amazon . it is 15 1 4 inches deep . here are the real dimensions : overall dimension : 25-inch w by 15-1 4-inch d by 28-1 4-inch h
you can contact seville classics at 1-800-323-5565 to get a copy of the instructions .
yes
yes , and the shelves can be spaced how you need.i really like this cart .
you can do that , but your files are more important for view so i have them on the top
i utilize it for filing paperwork as well as some of my craft supply . i own several types of seville shelves and carts mainly in my kitchen . they hold all my dishes and pots and pans as well as pantry items , so they are able to carry heavy items . i 'm not sure this seville cart would be able to carry a heavy printer .
the poles are roughly 3 4 '' in diameter .
the 15.25 is to the outside of the rail
the only time i have that problem is when the lead is getting too short for the pencil to `` hold '' onto . otherwise , i have not had a problem like this .
i revieved one shipment-package of two , individually packaged penils .
well there 's pens that are 2-in-1 , which have a pen and a mechanical pencil included , some of them come with caps . hope this helps !
i believe the lead that comes with this mechanical pencil is graded hb . so it 's pretty much middle of the road in terms of darkness hardness . i suspect it would work just fine . personally , i prefer softer darker lead . i generally use 4b lead which leaves a noticeably darker line but also breaks easier . i would think the darker the line , the easier ( faster ? ) it would be to fill in the little ovals on a scantron test . so it 's a matter of preference i suppose .
it 's placed in the top of the pencil where the eraser is located .
the kuru toga was originally meant for writing in kanji and kana , where your pencil leaves the paper . ( strokes ) if you write in cursive , you may not see a difference - but you 'll see it if you print ! : )
yes , it does . it works with windows xp , vista , 7 ( 32bit and 64 bit ) and windows 8 .
yes , standard 1 year warranty from canon .
the canon imageformula dr-6010c that i ordered worked on standard 110. no special plug needed .
it is one of the newer models and has worked wonderfully well with our 64 bit win 7 system . canon has also provided awesome tech support .
that is not why i use the scanner . however , the scanner can scan that type of paper and a skinnier width . the issue may be with the continuous nature of the roll ( unless you are talking about single receipts , then it can definitely handle it ) .
only 110v
yes it does . i have bought around 5 such notebooks over the past 2 years and have written on them exclusively with fountain pens , without issue . in comparison to other notebooks such as moleskin , there is never any bleed-through or smudges .
it 's hardcover .
the pages are numbered ( which is useful for creating tables of contents later ) and the outer material holds up a lot better than moleskines . the lines on the lined notebooks are slightly wider . i like them better for the durability - the spine is always fraying on my moleskines after a few months use !
there are 34 lines on each face of the page . there is more writable area ( 20-25 % more ) than 8.5x11 college rule .
the container for the slides are plastic , but the holes that the veho reads the slides thru are open .

i had windows 8 and it worked perfectly . then i downloaded windows 8,1 and it still worked like a charm .
if win8 works with ms paint , then yes . you see , you use the `` import from scanner or camera '' ability of mspaint to bring in the photo or negative shot from this little scanner . once you see the result in paint and decide you want to keep it ; you then use the `` save as ... '' function of paint to give it a name and send it to the file where you want to keep it .

i have no idea . it 's best to call a staples store or officemax to verify .
not sure what your question is
just to save little money , one incurs bigger loss . these cartridges if fits in it works , otherwise you throw away the useless one . the seller does n't take any responsibility to replace or refund . its better to pay more but you can get the right stuff or if its not working you can get replaced .

i believe legal files will fit . however , i do not believe legal hanging files will fit because there is no ledge on the front of the filing cabinet to hang the hanging file folder from .

yes . just buy the hanging folders and hang them on the bar .
yes mine came with wheels !
i am sorry i am not familiar with such joystick , however the mouse pads area is not sturdy at all , in fact one of mine broke after a few months and they made me pay for a replacement .
it does not matter , but i do n't use the tray as i am then too far away from my screen to see it well .
chair is not included . you can use any chair with arms . there is an extra adapter piece included to help mount the tray on curved arms .
this is a huge variable and depends alot on your chair . the depth of the seat pan , adjustability of the pan to the back , and the location and size of the arm rests . i have about 14 '' with a short seat pan and back adjusted close with short arm rests . i would think that i am near the minimum possible . i can see gaining as much as 6 '' with longer arm rests and the back rest adjusted further back . add in a longer seat pan and you might even get an addition two or more inches .

if the arms are cushioned fabric and you remove it after a long time , there are indents in the cushion , but these eventually go away over time . that happened to mine when i switched'it to another chair . however , this could easily be prevented by wrapping something around the fabric arms before attaching the device . the indentations definitely did go away after awhile .
i got a replacement arm a while back . just email support .
it 'll hold a laptop , but you have to be careful because the keyboard tray is n't attached to anything . it rests on the arms .
without a space below armrest you will have no way to mount this
i think they would work , but when our office moved , we switched to another type of sign holder and i have n't found one of these to try out .
they are 5 1 2 inches high by 5 1 8 wide . i used them for picture frames and glass hot plate displays . good product .
1 inch fits really well , may fit one a little bit thicker also .
no we had another model that did that , and i totally miss that feature . also display font is small , so it 's hard to read `` new voice mail '' . but sound quality is pretty good .
yes , it shows a message on screen ( voice mail )

it is always in the charger so it is hard to say how long it would last out of it . do like the phone though !
no , just the electric outlet needs to be plugged in ..as a suggestionyou can get an attachment to thephone jack that will allow you toplug in twoorhree extra phones..its about eight dollars or s
there 's no way to wall-mount any of the handsets . they 're strictly for desktop or tabletop .
yes i have them all wall mounted .
it is not detachable , it only collapses when the whole thing is folded up .
hard rubber
no . the liners are separate.it still works well though .
i had no problem . maybe try a little wd40 on the metal before snapping it in .
the embossing plates are plastic . i do n't think they would work on paper plates . sorry .
the company will send you an email after you order with instructions . customer service is very helpful if you would like to talk to someone about what font to choose etc .
after you order this embosser here , discount rubber stamps will send you an email later on , asking you for your initials , the type of font and die type . you reply with your answers and send them a pdf of how you want the image to look like .
i am not sure of your question but will give you the only answers that i have . the embossing plates are easy to slip in and slip out of the embosser device - they lock into place using two square holes that hold and lock in two protruding metal parts . this is not a super sturdy device and it requires a lot of strength ( to squeeze the embosser ) to ensure that the embossed impression is adequate . i am not able to picture your needs but i doubt you could mount your own dies as the mounting structure is precise - in other words the holes line up with the pieces of metal that stick out . sorry i can not be more helpful . i am not sure of your question but will give you the only answers that i have . the embossing plates are easy to slip in and slip out of the embosser device - they lock into place using two square holes that hold and lock in two protruding metal parts . this is not a super sturdy device and it requires a lot of strength ( to squeeze the embosser ) to ensure that the embossed impression is adequate . i am not able to picture your needs but i doubt you could mount your own dies as the mounting structure is precise - in other words the holes line up with the pieces of metal that stick out . sorry i ... » read more i am not sure of your question but will give you the only answers that i have . the embossing plates are easy to slip in and slip out of the embosser device - they lock into place using two square holes that hold and lock in two protruding metal parts . this is not a super sturdy device and it requires a lot of strength ( to squeeze the embosser ) to ensure that the embossed impression is adequate . i am not able to picture your needs but i doubt you could mount your own dies as the mounting structure is precise - in other words the holes line up with the pieces of metal that stick out . sorry i can not be more helpful . « show less
no it is not adjustable - -must go in from the bottom with about a 3-4 inch space . you do not need silver foil stickers - -you can emboss directly onto any paper .
yes . one at a time .
correct . it only raises the paper .
yes , it has worked well for me . i have been using this chip in a refilled cartridge for over a month . i use it every day . it prints like the new samsung cartridge that i bought for $ 60.00+ . it just takes a few minutes to empty , refill , change chip and reinstall in printer . good luck . j.m .
hello kaoru , yes , it will work with an scx-3200 printer . i always save the box to recycle , and your printer is listed on the box as being compatible with it . i 've been very happy with this cartridge , and it really lasts . the box says it will make 1500 copies , & it probably does . it lasts a very long time for me . hope this helps ! -eileen b .
i 'm sorry , i clicked yes by accident , but i have never had a problem with smearing . i would guess if it is smearing that there may be excess ink on the rollers . i would try to look up some ways of cleaning the rollers , i hope that helps .
it was a genuine samsung toner .
hello , i just bought one , so here goes : the box says it works with ml-166x , ml-167x , ml-186x , scx-320x , & scx-321x . the little 'x ' at the end of every set means any number that follows , so 1660 is a definite yes . prices : officemax and officedepot in store : $ 81.99 . if you check it online , officedepot has it for $ 65.99 . print it out , & take it to the store , and they will honor the online price ! i did . if amazon has it for less & free shipping , go for it .
a full set of 69ml starters are included thanks
hello , the unit comes with 69ml starter ink cartridges . it would be a good idea to purchase the full size 130ml inks - we sell them for $ 70 each if interested.thank you
not sure about that , but the printer utility , and both printer drivers have crashed multiple times in the past year . hp support does not know why , they just sugest a complete uninstal and reinstall each time . i love the quality of printing , but i hate the software .
no i am pretty sure that will not work in this machine ... .check mfg on that
the printer has a built in densitometer , so creating profiles for a new paper type is just a matter of a few mouse-clicks and waiting 20 minutes or so . you can buy non-hp inks from several sources , and they work pretty well , but i do gallery-quality prints that sell for > $ 1000 , so for me at least , skimping on ink would be foolish . ( note that , depending on how much printing you 're doing , you may elect to buy smaller , 130ml ink cartridges rather than the 300 ml cartridges that are standard . )

no , micros has a special interface in the back of the printer . the printer looks the same , but the interface in the back is different . if however you are replacing a printer , you can take the interface from your old printer , and plug it in the back of this printer , to make this printer compatible with micros .

it came with an ink roll in a seperate plastic bag and it is very easy to install .
hi , it has a little beep . it also has a light . i do n't pay that much attention to the workings of it , but i know if i 've been out all day and i come home and there 's a message there will be a quite , intermittent beep . if i check the caller ids without checking the messages , that beep changes to a small blue flashing led.i 'm pretty happy with these phones.hope i 've helped . happy holidays !
yes it is possible , just disable it during setup .
head set ? i think you mean `` handset '' talk time 24 hrs according to manual however i have never been on the phone longer than a two hour conference call . standby is several days . it 's pretty great .
yes every single handset has a headset jack !
yes , a double ring .
yes , according to the user 's guide you can use any industry standard 2.5mm headset . they recommend to use an at & t 2.5mm headset . there website address is www.telephones.att.com or call 1-800-222-3110. hope this helps

yes , the directory you mentioned is very easy to access . there is a little picture of an address book on the screen , you click on the button underneath it and that gives you the list of names you entered in the directory . there are arrows on the big round button on the top of the phone and you can scroll the list , up and down , with it . when the name you want appears on the screen , you click on `` talk . '' you can not add more than one number for each contact , but you can list that contact once for each number .
according to p. 25 of the owner 's manual , there are 5 ringtones and 5 melodies .
yes they do , down on the left side facing the keypad . by the way , this is by far the best phone i have ever owned.okay , i lied , but not intentionally . i was looking at the extra phone i purchased for this set which except for the color being black looks identical to the handsets that came with the set . so , the handsets with this set do not have a headset jack .
yes it does have the mute feature ... .. very good phone set has good charge life and range from base ... ..
this phone 's color is very pretty , but it does not meet your need for 4 phones .
mine is about 50 feet away from the main base and works fine -not sure about 150 .
yes . it 's the top right button . `` mute '' lights up on the screen when the call is made , then you press the top right button to mute .
uses a spiral insert . btw - very sturdy , yet light weight
there is n't a space made specifically for cards , but both front and back flaps have pockets the same size as your notebook refill . i only use one of the pockets for the notebook , so the other can be used for storage . this is top quality american made leather . ca n't go wrong .
no pencil or pen holder . there is a pocket for which the front flap of the notebook slides into . rite in the rain makes a zip model that fits the same notebook and has pencil holders but it 's nylon not leather .
i would think so . it measures 3.5 '' x 5.5 '' closed and about 3 8 '' thick . it has fit in every shirt pocket i have tried so far .
this listing is only for the cover . the cover is made for any of the rite in the rain 3 '' x 5 '' notebooks . ~rainwriter
i have the spiral notebook in mine and it works great .
this is a great pencil sharpener for the price . i even let the kids use it ( which normally i do n't because they break things ! ) sound wise it is n't a tiny `` hum '' , but it is n't super loud either . typical pencil sharpener noise , i 'd say . sorry if that does n't answer your question . a pencil sharpener in a school is an important thing . they usually break or sharpen unevenly . had this for 6 months and it 's going great !
this has a 1 year warranty .
yes
i have never used it to sharpen crayola pencils , but believe it would work fine even on the small hole . this pencil sharpener is worth the purchase . the best i have ever owned .
same as any other electric sharpener we 've had . but this one has outlasted all of them put together . works very well .
while it is an awesome sharpener ( seriously , i love this thing ! ) , golf pencils are too short .
sorry i do n't remember i donated it to my church . it work marvelously we love it .
it says this on the bottom ... . `` 120v 60hz 1.6a '' - so , i 'm guessing that means 120 volts ... i do n't really know , i just plug it in . it seems to have plenty of power . hope that was helpful - l
the sharpener has three holes - large , medium and small . the sharpener is called `` school smart '' , so would think the largest hole is meant to sharpen the fat school pencils . i use it to sharpen the more expensive colored pencils , but also to sharpen the cheap lead pencils . however , cheap pencils do n't sharpen as well as the more expensive ones on any type of sharpener . in my experience with cheaper pencils the lead will break often and the wood does n't sharpen all the way down the lead point . as for the pencils that are covered with a sort of paper , i have n't used it on this type . hope this helps ! the sharpener has three holes - large , medium and small . the sharpener is called `` school smart '' , so would think the largest hole is meant to sharpen the fat school pencils . i use it to sharpen the more expensive colored pencils , but also to sharpen the cheap lead pencils . however , cheap pencils do n't sharpen as well as the more expensive ones on any type of sharpener . in my experience with cheaper pencils the lead will break often and the wood does n't sharpen all the way down the lead point . as for the pencils that are covered with a sort of paper , i have n't used it on this type ... . » read more the sharpener has three holes - large , medium and small . the sharpener is called `` school smart '' , so would think the largest hole is meant to sharpen the fat school pencils . i use it to sharpen the more expensive colored pencils , but also to sharpen the cheap lead pencils . however , cheap pencils do n't sharpen as well as the more expensive ones on any type of sharpener . in my experience with cheaper pencils the lead will break often and the wood does n't sharpen all the way down the lead point . as for the pencils that are covered with a sort of paper , i have n't used it on this type . hope this helps ! « show less

i was unable to try `` 2 sided copying '' on the photosmart all in one . the photosmart suddenly stopped working . good luck , i hope someone else is able to answer your question .
when mine used to work correctly it used a sd card . it 's about three years old and must have had the equivalent of a stroke . soon it will be disposed of . now , its down to printing , and copying only . i do not recommend this printer .
it goes into a deep sleep based on the timeout you specify . then wakes up when a print job is received .
you can , but you might not like the results . colors tend to be muted and dull .
mine is 2 years old and i have filled the toner cartridges several times ... .i use a local company who specializesin refilling toner cartridges ... they find away to refill anything ! it might be that the original starter cartridge which lasts a very short time is sealed
i was interested in finding out if this would be a problem , so i removed the color cartridges from my printer and was able to still print in mono . hopefully this answers your question .
none at all . very smooth color print .
this printer does not scan .
yes it has a manual feed tray - the door drops and you can adjust the guides to fit envelopes or pop in small quantities special papers like colors or letterhead . i lay legal paper in the tray when i need that option . very useful feature and easy to use .
go to your `` printer and devices '' tab on your start menu and select ( double click ) your printer.select `` customize printer '' .once the window opens , under the `` general '' tab , click `` preferences '' .under the `` basic '' tab , you will see the color mono adjustment.change your settings to your desired choice , then click `` apply '' , then `` ok '' and you 're done.the settings are now saved.hope this helps .
it does not lock .
the sides and back are thin pieces of pressed board that slide into place . they match the rest , but are n't used for stability . the frame , drawer fronts and top are solid .
i can only give you a guess because it would depend on the folder thickness but 15 file folders per drawer easily . i love this file cabinet . love the style , easy to assemble and very sturdy . hope i 've helped you .
the drawers are fully enclosed like a night stand . it is more beige golden than off white .
no , although one could really be creative & install one but that would ruin the piece of furniture .
this holds hanging files . it is a nice , sturdy piece
believe it or not it looks just as it does in the picture . yes it is a yellow gold undertone with an antique finish .
not ball bearing . the drawers are on runners and do extend fully .
with files facing forward is a standard fit . maybe wide enough for legal if you were to place them sideways from front to back
like most other calculators of this type , it comes with a plastic cover for the front of the calculator that protects the keyboard and screen . there is no `` case , '' as in something that holds the entire calculator .
yes you can.there are many video on youtube to learn how to use this .
yes
yes - there is now a cas add-in for this calculator which will do this and a lot more - it 's called eigenmath and can be downloaded from www.cemetech.net
nope .
yes u can watch on youtube how to use this calculator
yes , if you hit the menu key and choose system , language is one of the items available . you hit the f3 key , scroll down to the bottom one which is chinese
i 've only used the wireless and wired method -- i know you have to have it set to one or the other -- you can call brother directly and ask - they have a great help line .
yes . there is no assigned drawer for legal sized paper but it handles that function using the multi-purpose tray that is also used to print envelopes , heavier weight paper , etc . i am still very pleased with the performance of this printer .
yes it does .

sorry , i had to look that up . no , it does not .
sorry to get back to you late but yes toner cartridges come with it . any new one will come with toner . it comes with the factory that way . there is quite a bit you have to do to remove all the temporary plastic pieces and tape installed for shipping related to just the toner cartridges in this machine .
first , the tape sticks well . i have never had one fall off or even peel back at the edges in the two or three years i have been using them . as long as you apply them properly , i do n't see any reason for concern . as far as residue is concerned , i have only had to remove a few over the past several months and do n't remember any of them having any residue other than a dirt line around the edge ! they peel off quite easily .
this product uses the tze tapes up to 0.47inches ( 12mm ) wide . a model no . tape could be the tze-231 .
all i ever use it for is glass containers . so , yes , it works great on glass
to the best of my knowledge this labeling machine only takes one size of tape and the specifics about that should be with the product description . the print size can be adjusted up or down to make the print fit into the length of tape you need .
the paper is self adhesive tape that is laminated over the printed words . there are two strips on the back you peel off to expose the sticky part and then affix the label to your item .
i 've never needed a power adapter ; it works great with the batteries only ; it takes 6 aaa batteris ... .it is a seperate purchase for the power adapter .

the machine can handle about 50 or more of the same size sheets as long as you fold them first .
not based on operation manuals that are included.however it really only does a reasonable job on flat copy print paper.do n't try to load docs or envelopes that are uneven or folded , as they just jam up .
yes
it 's tough for me to answer that since i 've only had one or two other shredders in my lifetime . i can say that when using the closed-lid shredding option ( the one which i do n't feel works very well ) , the shredder is quieter than most others because the action is going on inside the machine .
yes , the 100x shreds junk-mail . junk mail is best fed through the manual slot to avoid jams.lynn , acco brands
works great . i tend to use the manual feed due to the irregular papers i shred . use it almost daily to dispose of junk mailings .

you do n't have to plug the hole with a custom plug . you can use duck tape or various layers of electrical tape to cover the hole . but if you 're committed to creating a custom plug , the diameter of the hole made by the tool is 17.39 mm or about 11 16 '' .

i am using it on an hp cartridge . you could probably make the hole in the plastic with a soldering iron , but this makes it easy . it make the hole the right size to pour in the toner . keep in mind that it is a really dirty job . even with the right size hole , the toner still gets all over the place . do it outside . i am not sorry that i bought this .
yes , that 's the way i have mine setup . and i feed labels and envelopes through the manual tray . it knows what size paper is in each tray and automatically does it 's thing.great printer ! there 's even a wireless app for your tablet or phone . scan and copy work well also .
the brother mfcj6710dw can scan an 11x17 document in one pass . one must use the lower tray , expanded to hold the 11x17 paper , and adjust the paper selection to ledger paper size using the menu function . do n't forget to reset the paper size on the menu function after printing the ledger sized document ( s ) .
if i understand you correctly , you want to connect the printer to your laptop via usb . if that 's it , open the scanner cover ; the usb socket is inside the machine on the right , next to where you store the orange protective part for the ink cartridges . did n't get a usb cable with the printer . p.s . i 'm really liking this printer .
excellent ; not problems .
i do n't believe it prints directly onto cd 's but will do nice cd labels that you can stick on the cd
i fill the tray with about 80 to 100 sheets . i run two sets of 40 ( 11x17 ) at a time . i feel it is safer than having a mistake or jam .
both uses are available
yes ( though document feeder )
no , they are thin paper copies
it 's a shrink wrapped package of 100 .
if they have an old style card with the raised numbers they will all appear . but more and more the cards being issued are smooth so this imprinter does not pick up any numbers at all and you need to write them in . we switched to card swipers , square and intuit 's system , there also a couple more , paypal has one . these are way easier and have many features this old printer can not do -- like bookkeeping , emailing receipts , etc . you can even log in cash sales to keep track of everything . forget about using this old thing , go to square or one of the other similar card swipe options . now they can even save swiped data and upload it later if you are someplace without internet access . the future is here . good luck ! if they have an old style card with the raised numbers they will all appear . but more and more the cards being issued are smooth so this imprinter does not pick up any numbers at all and you need to write them in . we switched to card swipers , square and intuit 's system , there also a couple more , paypal has one . these are way easier and have many features this old printer can not do -- like bookkeeping , emailing receipts , etc . you can even log in cash sales to keep track of everything . forget about using this old thing , go to square or one of the other similar card swipe options . now they can ... » read more if they have an old style card with the raised numbers they will all appear . but more and more the cards being issued are smooth so this imprinter does not pick up any numbers at all and you need to write them in . we switched to card swipers , square and intuit 's system , there also a couple more , paypal has one . these are way easier and have many features this old printer can not do -- like bookkeeping , emailing receipts , etc . you can even log in cash sales to keep track of everything . forget about using this old thing , go to square or one of the other similar card swipe options . now they can even save swiped data and upload it later if you are someplace without internet access . the future is here . good luck ! « show less
it will increase slowly .
if you check the fine print of the product description it says packed 100
blueboy your question should be directed toward the supplier . i can only answer questions on product performance .
yes ! that 's what we do .
yes it will . at the vpedal website , there is a plugin that you would download , and then from that plugin you would assign whatever the keyboard shortcuts are for : play , pause , fast forward , rewind , etc. , and those keyboard shortcuts then transfer to the foot pedal . i can also use this foot pedal with other forms of transcription software such as express scribe ( free ) , olympus transcription software , itunes , and quicktime player 7. i hope this information is helpful .
i do n't believe you need special software . when you receive the footpedal , you go to vpedal.com and download the software needed to run the vpedal itself . i only have one usb port that works on my desktop computer , so when i have the audio or video that needs to be transcribed on my flash drive , i move it from the flash drive to the computer . then i can plug in and use the vpedal . hope that answers your question .
unfortunately i have never had this problem with my vpedal so i 'm not sure what to tell you .
when you power off it will stay every data and configuration . when you power on it , you could to resume the calculations you were working , in this is the best calculator , but el-w516xb has a useless function how to multiplication table math , fx-991es has anymore function useful how to table function f ( x ) and vector operations , but do n't remain the data when you power off it , impossibility to resume the calculations ... .
before you return , try resting it by a window to charge the solar cells . i have found that if i do n't use it for a while it may not come on until it gets a few minutes `` in the sun '' . i think that it should not do that but after 10-15 minutes it was functioning , and for weeks .
you can store four formulas in f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 . i have stored the quadratic formulas and the vertex formulas for a parabola , -b 2a , ( 4ac-b^2 ) 4a .
yesit is explained in manual.but , i can not find pi constant .
this calculator comes with two instruction sheets that are about 24 by 15 inches in size , and they are double sided . the one sheet describes all of the functions of the calculator , while the other provides examples of these functions . it probably would have been nicer to have a booklet format with a table of contents and an index . the sheets are fairly comprehensive though .
the phone just rings like a normal land line . yes just get a phone number account from www.google.com voice . i think you can transfer a number over for $ 25 . hook the obi to the router with a cat 5 cable . hook a phone to the obi and pick up the receiver . directions are simple after that . you will also need to go to the obitalk site and sign in with google . you can use it for one phone or feed the entire house with it for multiple phones . i think the obi recommends the 110 if you feed the house , but the 100 worked for me but i da n't have any old style phones that might draw more power . free phone , voice mail , call forwarding , voice mail to text . can even search for phone numbers by letter designation names . good luck . the phone just rings like a normal land line . yes just get a phone number account from www.google.com voice . i think you can transfer a number over for $ 25 . hook the obi to the router with a cat 5 cable . hook a phone to the obi and pick up the receiver . directions are simple after that . you will also need to go to the obitalk site and sign in with google . you can use it for one phone or feed the entire house with it for multiple phones . i think the obi recommends the 110 if you feed the house , but the 100 worked for me but i da n't have any old style phones that might draw more power . free ... » read more the phone just rings like a normal land line . yes just get a phone number account from www.google.com voice . i think you can transfer a number over for $ 25 . hook the obi to the router with a cat 5 cable . hook a phone to the obi and pick up the receiver . directions are simple after that . you will also need to go to the obitalk site and sign in with google . you can use it for one phone or feed the entire house with it for multiple phones . i think the obi recommends the 110 if you feed the house , but the 100 worked for me but i da n't have any old style phones that might draw more power . free phone , voice mail , call forwarding , voice mail to text . can even search for phone numbers by letter designation names . good luck . « show less
if you have a phone that let 's you program in an emergency number you could do that . this device is not really intended to let a free google voice number be your primary phone for emergencies though . it is a great backup line if your cell has an issue . perhaps posting emergency 10 digit numbers by phones would be the best idea .
obi does n't assign phone numbers . you get the phone number from google voice . the obi just let 's you access the google voice account over your traditional home phones .

it is easy to configure , just logon to obi talk.com . you would need a gmail account with voice . you do n't need to create another account on obi talk . just login with your gmail then add the device . on doing the configuration , it will show a number to call and you would need to dial the . # number . before you start this make sure this adapter is connected to internet and the telephone is connected to the adapter . last in your google voice account select the option to forward calls to only your gmail account so all calls get routed to your phone .
there 's a lot of great information here : http : www.voipmyhouse.com
i use obi100 with my google voice account . through my google account i am able to blacklist or whitelist callers . google voice can also be set to block calls and texts it identifies as spam .
the obi100 has a one year warranty from the manufacture but if you only only had it for 2 weeks amazon may replace it for you.note that the issue may only be the 12v power supply that went bad , so check if you have a spare from another device .
you can call out to non voip phones , ie pots or cell phone numbers . you will want to pair the obi devicewith google voice for access to and from those other non obi device lines . it is pretty easy a to pair it with google voice
sorry , i ca n't answer that . we 're out of the country for the next three months so i ca n't measure it for you .
i got this for my job at the time at which i am no longer at . i want to say yes , you can assemble it without the roll out keyboard , but i honestly do n't remember exactly how it assembled . i 'm 90 % sure that you can assemble the desk without it .
length is 31 1 2 and width is 23 '' . hope that helps .
yes , the base unit .
i dont use a head set but i do not see where u can use it on the phone .
i do n't believe it is .
yes it shows on the caller id screen on the handset .
no , and that was the biggest disappointment
yes
it can be set to always stay on . very easy to stup .
it 's always faster to measure than i am . but i 'm using it to weight for postage . for a quick tap , i dont know and suspect you are looking at the wrong scale . it 's meant for packages . even if it read the quick tap and your software grabed only the max entry , not sure how accurate it would be . do know that as you press on the scale , you can see the weight change on the pc . i 'm using shipworks.hope that helps you out .
yes , it 's compatible with endicia for mac , it works perfectly . dymo endicia offers it on their website ( for more $ ) so you know if they sell it , it is compatible .
the ones ordered do come with numbers
they are in sheet form with perforations . i really do n't know if they would stay together well enough to be printed . they 're pretty tough though . made it through water when we used them .
sharpie works great on them ! did not bleed through .
i have an hp 1212nf mfp printer , fax , copier , and i use the st-ce 285a cartridge , and i have had no problems . the cartridge just slides in and worked great .
the box the cartridge came in noted it fit the following units : 1212nf , 1214nfh , 1217nfw etc . i have the 1212 , and it works great in my unit .
yes it does . i 'm only on the first cartridge of the 4-pack and it made a mess of the powder ink inside the printer . once i ran a few pages through and cleaned it up inside ( under the ink cartridge ) it works really good .
yes , this is the alternative to an actual hp cartridge . they work great !
while i did not count the number of pages printed , it was comparable to the number printed out from oem cartridges . in fact , some generic cartridges seemed to equal the number printed from the extended-life cartridges . in terms of drying out , the good thing about laser toners is that they are dry to begin with , so they can last for years and years and not suffer degradation . inkjet cartridges have a limited shelf-life , but i do n't think laser toners do . if they do , then it is a very long shelf life . i use generic toner cartridges now because of substantial savings . hope this helps .
yes , that 's the same printer i use them in .
i am using the printer cartridges in my h p lazerjet m 1212nfmfp and they work fine . i get clean copies with no smudging , and they are crisp . i can recommend themron brunner
the wooden tray is 19 '' wide and about 14 '' deep . so , i would think so .
i do n't know , but the outer material is quite heavy duty , and the filling feels firm , like more of the same material folded up . it does not feel like a foam , or beans .
the cushion ca n't be unzipped , but you can take it off & wash the whole thing which is what i did
i 'm honestly not sure . whatever it is , it 's incredibly durable as it 's used daily .
yes .
i am using my dymo with macbook air with i7 processor , which is a 64 bits processor . my dymo cardscan is both mac and windows compatible . my recommendation is that you do verify with www.dymo.com just to make sure .
vdi , yes . win 8 , i 'm unsure . i know that dymo 's tech support is extremely helpful . 1-877-724-8324
yes , with little or no effort , my windows 7 detected the driver and ran the product flawlessly !
once you have scanned the cards , you have the option of outputting it in different formats including spreadsheet .
the answer is yes i just ran my own to be sure . this is a great tool . the wolff
yes it does ! its a decent product for the price . my wife uses it on a daily basis and has not complained ...
it 's a comfy chair but if you are looking for sink factor you might want to upgrade a bit . it 's more firm than plush though more than enough plush for the backside
excellent back support , i 'm 6'4 '' tall and weigh 265 pounds . i use the chair and it is great .
arms are not adjustable ... the chair itself will go up or down by the pneumatic handle control and you can adjust the rocking ability by the adjustable knob .
hi john this chair is very easy to put together , it can be done in 10 min with just one person . i would start with the base , add the wheels then add the pneumatic stand , screw the base plate to the bottom of the chair with the four screw bolts and then place the base onto the top of the pneumatic stand , lift the back rest in to position and carefully by hand place the 2 screws by hand into the back rest and arm rest holes , then gently tighten them by hand until both are in both holes then use the tool proved to then tighten until firmly in place ... . very easy to do .
... that knob is for the balancing of the chair ... ( sorry my english ) ... the more tied you set , the less balancing you get on the chair , the more loose is , you got more balancing .
the seat is 20 '' but outside to outside arms are 25 ``
no . it has a slight rocking movement almost like a rocking chair .
i wanted to order a small radio for my mum who is sick in hospital in bucharest , and i can not find one with headphones and batteries in the shops.unfortunately , you deliver no electronics either , despite advertising delivery rates.such a shame .
you should be good to go
have had this stand for over a year with 3 `` 24 '' inch hd monitors with no hassles at all . the wing monitors can be adjusted in or out with no interference to the center monitor . the cable holding system makes it all neat . i have been very happy with this stand . good luck
i have 3 x 24 '' dell 2405fpw .. the old heavy ips panel 22.1 lbs each and it holds them just fine with plenty of room to spare in width and length . i would say that if you have newer 27 '' panels ( which are usually lighter ) you would be good to go . hope this helps !
ca n't
its completely adjustable . if you want the a flat or 90 degree you can choose that . its quite heavy as well i get earthquakes here and it does n't move .
i think it 's worth it because of the design of it . you can pay $ 200 less for something that looks bland on a desk . also you have easy access to 2 usb port in the middle and i can layout my keyboard and mouse line short and neat .
26 inches across and 18 inches width at the farthest points on the base .
just one . i wish i had bought several .
that 's what i thought ; but you only get one ( and they choose the color . ) this is a deceptive seller as there is no way that one pouch is $ 40 .
it is for a set of 24 ( assorted colors ) - i purchased these for use in the classroom and they are great , very durable
yes it did include the chip . the chip seems to work fine .
i have n't really kept track . i 'm still on my first refill .
assuming you have a printer model that works with the refill kit , there could be a problem with the chip you replaced . is the new chip installed in the cartridge in the correct orientation ? did you try using the old chip instead of the new one ?
http : www.youtube.com watch ? v=1lmjviw1z9c
no i do n't believe it 's normal
i am sorry to say that the new one i received did not work . my printer did not recognize it . and now my printer is giving me printing issues even after we had followed all instructions .
no , but it does have triangle style hooks on the ends so you can hang it vertical or horizontal .
i am not sure . i own 4 of these boards and i plug them into a standard outlet . however , there is a usb type plug that gets plugged into the board itself and the controller for the board is actually a part of the cord . you might want to check with the manufacturer . i had a couple of questions and they responded to me right away .
i have one of these ... dry erase with a microfiber cloth leaves a ghost image of what you drew . if you get it wet , then use another one to dry it is much better . sometimes i have to do that twice .
there are hooks on the back to hang either vertical or horizontal . it does not come with hardware for hanging though . i originally was going to buy a chain for hanging it , but decided not to hang it .
no remote in ours . we love it !
yes
i only show one photo , & that 's the one i purchesed . absolutely love it . clears up a lot of space in my desk .
we received ours in january 2014 and it measures 17-3 4 '' . it is a really solid , well made unit .
i do n't know ... ..it must have a spec from the manufacturer . it is very strong solid , with the weak point probably being the platform itself as it is just heavy gauge sheet metal .
if the vertical pole is the same diameter , and if the other mounts on the pole can be removed so this one can slide on , one should be able to mount this arm on the pole . this arm 's pole mount has very little adjustment range so the pole diameter would have to be nearly identical . hope that helps !
the full extension of the arm is about 13 '' , and that is to the center of the notebook platform so you would lose about 5 '' there . i do not think it would be long enough to extend over a bed to a lap position .
the platform the laptop rests on is 14 '' x 11.5 '' .and because there are no side or back ridges ( only a front one ) , your laptop can overhang a little w o problem.the bottom of the platform is all perforated so there is no problem with ventilation .
from center line on mounting post ( vertical tube ) to the approximate center of tilting pc plate , the answer is 16 '' and to the end of tilt plate about 22 inch . arm swing at the mounting post is 360 degrees . arm is made of 4 sections , 2 '' 7 '' 5 '' & 2 '' ( approximate ) with horizontal pivots at each end , except for the vertical tilt pivot at bottom of pc plate . this allows for limitless positioning . hope this helps
if mounted onto something that is at standing level , then yes , this could be used as a standing desk keyboard holder . i do n't know the exact dimensions ; you 'd have to check that on the amazon specs given in the information on the description provided by amazon . i was very pleased with the keyboard holder .
yes it does , great product.. i actually bought 2 of them .
11.75 inches wide by 11.5 inches deep . i 've used it to hold both a 15 '' macbook pro and a high-end 17 '' gaming laptop and it 's reasonably stable . the front lip will keep a laptop from sliding off as long as you do n't tilt it too much and the platform has decent ventilation . a macbook pro will slide around a bit though .
it uses aaa batteries , i 'm not sure if you can find rechagable batteries that can be used instead of the aaa batteries .
yes is translate english to spanish ans you can also put in spanish to english , you can do this in tha menu
i use the franklin bes1940 as an electronic dictionary and as a pronunciation guide . i have found the pronunciations are accurate for the type of spanish spoken in the sw united states . for the money , this device is well worth it . the battery life is very good also .
no , just spanish .
yes . it has a volume adjust and you turn it all the way off ... . plus it does n't talk unless you press the speaker icon anyway .
unfortunately , you ca n't translate whole sentences . they only provide you with a list of their own sentences that are already in the device .
this product is 5 1 2 inches long by 4 1 2 inches wide by about 1 2 inch thick . hope this helps .
hi . it does not come batteries , so you should get 2 aaa batteries .
yes the notepad can be removed . i have replaced it several times . the calculator can be removed with a little effort . it is only held in place by the edges . no glue or anything is used . side note , i have had this for a year and use it 5 days a week for work , it has held up well . it looks as good as it did when i got it . the loop the holds the strap in place shows some wear , but that 's all .
yes , it fits perfectly . i love it !
i bought it as a gift so ca n't remember the size of the calculator , but 3 '' x 6 '' sounds about right . the build quality is excellent for the price . there are several pouches in which you can storage your extra electronics .
yup , sure does . decently sturdy too , not horribly flimsy like some out there . been using this portfolio for a while now , and it 's been a good replacement for the price . biggest downside is storage space for documents , it 's super limited . not a big deal for me since i 'm fairly paperless in my office , but it 's annoying sometimes .
yup
no it is too tight only holds a pad .
no , it does n't have a handle .
not at all .
it does n't really cool as far as i can tell , it just keeps the heat off your lap .
yup it comes in a thin cardboard box .
yes , it is not ideal for writing on.plastic , it 's one solid piece , real flat . just the top is rubbery.i hope that helps . we love ours , it 's perfect for my son .
i have a 15 inch and it handles that size just right . it would be a tight squeeze for a 17 inch .
yes , it is .
i believe the dimensions are : 11.4 x 14 x 1.6 inchesi 'm taking this information from this page ( http : www.amazon.com logitech-939-000181-portable-lapdesk-n315 dp b002ntadvw ) which is the same exact model , different color .
absolutely , its not direction specific .
yes this phone is cordless it works great my mom is hard of hearing and it amplifies enough so she can hear good when talking
no it sets on a desk just like the picture . it is wireless i have used the phone up to 50 feet from the main station . i am very happy with it .
button on the right side of the base will turn off the answering machine . it looks like an on off button . i inadvertently deactivated the answering function myself .
it is very simple to setup.install the two included aaa re-chargeable batteries and allow them to charge for the specified time and the phone is ready to use .
that 's correct -- messages only playback on the base . those 'missed calls ' on the handset refer to unanswered calls that left no messages and as stated in previous answer to your question , calls by telemarketers . telemarketers use autodialers that placed several calls at once . then they talk to the first person who picks up the phone and hang up on everybody else . i find that most of the 'missed messages ' come from callers that i 'm glad i missed .
do n't waste your money . the range on these phones is horrible . i bought the base and 3 handsets , and none of them worked anything to what you would consider normal . hard to pair with the base also , but after a lot of effort , i finally did get them paired , but they just never worked . if you are within 20 ' you may be ok , but in different rooms , you will not . be happy . i sent everything back , and went back to my old panasonic system .
no , i assume because so many devices use usb a-b cables , manufacturers typically assume you already have one . you can buy one from amazon ( http : www.amazon.com startech-6-feet-usb-certified-cable dp b000067spp ref=sr_1_2 ? ie=utf8 &qid; =1352588507 &sr; =8-2 &keywords; =usb+a-b+cable ) for as little as $ 7 including shipping or even less if bundled with another order . local suppliers may even beat this price but places like office supply stores or best buy will likely only stock `` name brand '' stuff costing a lot more ( and which i assure you perform no better ) .
i 'm not sure . we have ipad 3 and mini and it works great with those , not sure about 2 .
you would select the 2-sided copy feature so that you do n't have to re-insert the copied paper . however , you do have to turn the original since there is no document feeder . it 's done with a very nice user interface telling you exactly what to do and when to turn the original . this is really a very nice printer . i 've had 4 canon printers over the last 25 years and they have performed well and last a long time .
you can send a print job from a iphone from a cellular network so it should be able from a mac .
yes ... and easy to do , although i have n't had any need to do so for cleaning ( i removed it to see what would be entailed in replacing it , which i abandoned once i found out a new print head cost more than the printer ) .
yes you can print from a smart phone or tablet . in order to accomplish this you need to visit the ap store and search for either canon mobile printing or pixma printing solutions . both have scan features along with printing .
no-see my review . it prints ( slowly at first ) , copies and scans ( with no feeder ) . it 's totally mislabeled as an all in one when it 's only a 3 in 1
no . if you check the manual , copies have to be placed on the glass , it does n't have an adf function . in the manual , it clearly says you put it on the glass , press copy , and it gives you the option of putting the next document on . so , check the manual .
no , i did n't receive the guarantee certificate .
yes
there are no serial numbers on this clip anywhere . all it says on the clip is made in germany .
yes
we dont do engraving . it 's a authentic pen .
mont blanc does have a blue pen as well as a red one . and a metal one too . different colors they make . but this specific model 105657 only comes one way . i would suggest checking for other styles
no this is not authentic . the do n't have pix . under the clip
it does not scan , but it does duplex printing both sides in color and black .
hi nancy , mpt paper size weight letter , legal , statement , a4 , a5 , a6 , b5 , b6 , custom 16 lb bond - 120 lb index.thanksanthony j argy srfull color copier inc .
yes to # 1 & not sure on the memory stick , sorry .
yes colored pencils write easily on these labels . they are non-shiny , with a flat finish ( like paper ) and they work well with printer ink , pencil , pen , etc . very versatile labels ... ..and they look great .
no , they are not waterproof .
it 's 3 columns x 4 rows , so 12 labels to a page .
no . i have not tried to remove them . permanent vs removable is what they are referring to . removable means it is easy to remove and leaves little if any residue , if you are planning to remove the labels , get removable ones . if you are not then buy permanent .
i have a hplaser jet pro 200 and they work well : )

they are matte
yes
yes mine is .
the sides are each 3 1 2 inches wide .
no , it does n't . i just love my desk set ( blotter and pencil cup ) it makes my roll-top look so handsome . i went out and bought a green poster board to slip into the blotter , and it looks great . hope you enjoy it . yvette cronin .
douglas , i do n't recall the exact measurements , i 'm sorry . i bought this for my sister who wanted a particular color insert for the blotter . i could n't find what i wanted in any of the office supply stores so i went to an art supply store and purchased a sheet of paper that was the same texture as the standard inserts and available in many colors . i then cut it to size and my sister had exactly what she wanted . this could be an alternative to putting a calendar into your blotter . calendar-li
it 's like a felt bottom . soft and does not slip for us . still in excellent condition since the day we purchased it .
yes it does .
i do n't know . i have not used 111lb cardstock .
this printer never worked properly i spent hours trying to figure out things . does not work well with mac . finally gave it away .
no , you can just replace one cartridge and keep on going , good question , its not like a ink jet printer it 's different , so you will like this printer and it works well as a fax , copier and an all in one
hi , pj ! yes , the canon imageclass mf8380cdw is ready for windows 8. hope this helps !
the scanner is one feature of the printer that i like . it scans two sided and is fast . it does not by default give searchable pdfs . that probably requires setting up ocr software .
no . only letter and legal .
it has both wired and wireless ethernet interfaces - pick one as desired .
it is very easy and quick . telescope legs with clamps , so much faster and less frustrating than the old style .
our board is exactly your measurements . works great for football .
this is pretty well built easel . we used it for displaying large presentation boards . in terms of weight i am not sure how much weight it can hold but i say at least 25 lb or more . i am certain about one thing , you can use it to display any size of heavy foam board .
it should . i 've used it for poster board 36 '' wide and 24 '' high and seems to be enough space for something a little bigger .
no - it may be wide enough but not tall enough . the biggest i 've put on is 24 x 36 horizontal
white
it does n't come with one , but it has an input for one . i have run through about 8 rolls of 1 2 '' tape on the same set of batteries .
i am familiar with essential oils little bottles . yes , this dymo labeler will do the job . i actually print small labels that fit on a tie strap label tag . that 's a tie strap with a small 10mmx20mm square patch for the label . works fine for that . hope that helps ...
came with one roll of labeling tape
the dymo 4200 machine . charger , adaptor , battery , tape not included . indeed , good price .
it is good on glass , plastic , and smooth metal surfaces .
i think you can buy a kit that has the power supply with it.. i did not get a power supply with my dymo 4200. i had a brady lable maker that i replaced that had a power supply and that power supply works with the dymo . it is 9 volts dc @ 2.2 amps made by switch mode power supply .
i have used both , a brother label maker , not sure of the model , but similar . i found dymo to be a superior product . the dymo rhino is rugged , prints better , real solid over brother and dymo is inexpensive . i think you pay for that `` brother '' name brand .
i 'm sorry i do n't know the answer to that question , but i would think that it would be , its a new printer , so it should be

yes it does .
yes , i have one and it works great .
lexmark recommends letting windows 8 and 8.1 use the in-os drivers . so the printer is compatible with win 8.1 .
my experience has been that when my color cartridges run out , everything prints in black .
yes , it prints in color . the ink cartridges are expensive but the colors are very good .
i do n't know . but i have an imac and it does somehow connect wirelessly . for a cheap printer it is fine , though the original toner cartridge did n't last very long at all
it is readable and all but the colors really add a lot of information .
my key card and id are both 2 1 8 '' x 3 3 8 '' and fit perfectly . i just measured and it will fit up to 2 3 8 '' maximum . if this wo n't work maybe the side opening holders would be an option for the larger cards ?
it is to fasten it to belt loop or brief case or what ever .
yes , i have two cards in it .
no . just one in the front .
there is no closure specifically . however if you attached this using a retractable badge reel or a lanyard , the slit that you would attach it to is on both front and back , so your clip would hold the front and back together essentially acting as a closure to keep the i 'd inside . if used alone , there is no actual closure on top .
yes , it is easy to remove .
probably 2-3
i do n't have any information from the manufacturer , but i was stepping on them ( 115lbs ) and they seemed to hold up just fine .
the domes have a flat base ( like half of a solid ball ) . so they squish down when you step on the numbered side , but you couldnt step in and out of the bottom .
they usually wo n't slide . but they flip over after the child jumps
neither . they are thick rubber and hold their shape . when stepped on they squeeze down . underneath is an air intake hole . as they regain their shape they fill with air from the intake .
i am not really sure but my 2 yr old uses them .
not that i know of , but i thought i was buying the brand , not an off-market , so i 'm not even sure the brand name cartridges are still the same . i do n't know whether to blame amazon or samsung for this snafu , but somebody better clean up their act .
mine is i think the clx-3185 . you need to check with the manufacturer .
yes it has all four toners in it .
it 's not listed as compatible , so i do n't know . i 'm sure you could find the same product for your printer . suggest an amazon or google search for clp 320 replacement cartridges .
this is not exactly true . i own the printer ( clp 325w ) . the original cartridges are rated 700 for color and 1000 black white . the replacement cartridges are rated 1000 and 1500.i am already upto 458 and 661 pages for color and b w. the usage shows 15 % remaining for b w and from 17 % to 39 % for the individual colors , so your mileage may vary .
i 've used the printer for printing legal sized documents quite a bit , and it works just fine . the printer does not have a duplexer , however . manually turning the pages is necessary to print on both sides of a sheet .
you can easily feed an envelope into it . i have never fed more than one at a time . i use it mostly for printing high quality photos and have occasionally noticed paper jam with thick photo papers . i would recommend this printer for it 's sharp high resolution color prints not for heavy duty use . the ink cartridges are very small and although printer has a solid build quality , it is not made for high volume printing .
jim the glass surface is 11 3 4 x 8 1 2 the other scanner onthe top can be scanned and faxed those size documents are ok
it works sometimes . it always works sending . but about half the time i get an error on incoming faxes .
yes , the toners are very small ( specially the color ones , black toner is slightly larger ) but with moderate use they last a while .
they will replace it and you send the broken one back . at least that how it has been for me .
not directly because this printer doesnt has airprint , but you can print with a program called cloudprint . hope this help you
this printer works very well with macs as well as windows 8. i have several computers at home with different operating systems and they all work well .
it is completely blank , no embossing : )
the pages are not lined .
it will bleed i had to get my husband a different pen..sorry
i bought for a steampunk prop . but also use to journal our event outings . i think it will be fine for you .
you can try ordering it from amazon germany . go to amazon.indiary.de to see our whole array of products.your indiary-customercare
fine point or a felt pen
yes you can
yes
if the printer is indeed a m601n ( the `` n '' is for network ) , then it will have a standard ethernet connection for network connectivity . you would use a standard cat-5 or cat-6 network cable to connect the printer to your data network .
yes . even has the factory hp tape all around it . i was pretty impressed , as i assumed it would have something noticeable about it that would remind me what it was 1 2 the price of a new one . not sure if they all look like mine did , but i was more that impressed and even more happy with what i received . it has full amazon satisfaction guarantee , so you ca n't lose anyhow . give it a shot , i 'll definitely do it again myself . hope that helps .
yes . here are the specs . http : www.shopping.hp.com shopping pdf ce990a.pdf search for airprint.hope this helps
it depends . if they are new oem they will ship from a hp warehouse . if they are refurbished then they will ship directly from us in dallas .
the ink cartridge itself is 2 '' l x 1.75 h ( by tallest part ) x 1.25 w ( by widest part )
if you place your black catridge in the correct spot and keep the color catridge empty your printer should operate . mine does . hope that helps : )
because the cartridges are sealed with a piece of tape and hermetically sealed in a plastic cup i would think as long as you store them in a cool dark place there should n't be a problem . the sealed cups have printing on them but not an expiration date , i 've stored them for months without problems- and i live in the high desert .
yes , black always runs out first . i purchase the 241xxl , lasts longer . the color has less ink as the cartridge shares the container with three separate colors . i have n't been able to purchase the color cartridge in xxl . you can set your canon to only print in black ink to save the color for more important printings . i am a writer , so i use more black than color anyway . i plan to purchase an hp laser to print my black print as the toner cartridges will print thousands of sheets of black type before running out , and you have plenty of notice . worked for hp for almost 20 years . do n't get me wrong , i love my canon color printer , but it can get pricey when it comes to toner , as all ink jets do . if you choose to refill your cartridges by injecting ink into the cartridge , you must do so when the cartridge is runnign low , as the printer has a sensor and will not allow a cartridge that has run dry to be refilled and used . i have no idea how it senses this money saving technique , but it does . you can save mucho bucks by doing this if you have the patience . yes , black always runs out first . i purchase the 241xxl , lasts longer . the color has less ink as the cartridge shares the container with three separate colors . i have n't been able to purchase the color cartridge in xxl . you can set your canon to only print in black ink to save the color for more important printings . i am a writer , so i use more black than color anyway . i plan to purchase an hp laser to print my black print as the toner cartridges will print thousands of sheets of black type before running out , and you have plenty of notice . worked for hp for almost 20 years . do n't get me ... » read more yes , black always runs out first . i purchase the 241xxl , lasts longer . the color has less ink as the cartridge shares the container with three separate colors . i have n't been able to purchase the color cartridge in xxl . you can set your canon to only print in black ink to save the color for more important printings . i am a writer , so i use more black than color anyway . i plan to purchase an hp laser to print my black print as the toner cartridges will print thousands of sheets of black type before running out , and you have plenty of notice . worked for hp for almost 20 years . do n't get me wrong , i love my canon color printer , but it can get pricey when it comes to toner , as all ink jets do . if you choose to refill your cartridges by injecting ink into the cartridge , you must do so when the cartridge is runnign low , as the printer has a sensor and will not allow a cartridge that has run dry to be refilled and used . i have no idea how it senses this money saving technique , but it does . you can save mucho bucks by doing this if you have the patience . « show less

mine does the same thing , usually in the middle of printing a photo or multiple pages . i emailed seller for a replacement chip circuitry cartridges . they replied saying to press the reset button ( which i 've done countless times ) , then they said it was out of warranty and they do n't sell just the circuitry . you have to buy the whole kit .
look closely at the picture of the cartridge you put into the printer , the inkwells might be in a different order but the cartridge should match . my ink wells are not the order of my printer but the cartridge does match . as long as the printer cartridge is in the correct order you will have no problems.. its a great system . been using mine for well over a year with no problems.. and saved a tone of $ $ on ink . again just make sure you get the right system by looking at the order of the printer cartridge , not the order of the inkwells .
i use it for an artisan 837 - i do have challenges with the `` ribbon '' that runs from the cartridge to the ink - it runs under the lid and sometimes the sensor thinks the lid is up and or invalid cartridge - a little bit of an annoyance for saving the landfills
hi there , sorry i can not answer your ? check on google and ask them , or contact the ink co. to see if they list that epson printer , as i said before it works great . when you order also order the refills at the same time it will save you shipping money like i did ... thanks stewart ... gsphotovideo.com
either remove and replace the ink cartridge the printer thinks is empty , or try just opening and shutting the unit like you are going to replace the ink cartridge . i simply open and shut the machine . there is no way that i know of to stop the printer from thinking its out of ink .
no , the fantasy bulk system comes with a simulated ink cartridge pack , as seen in the picture , that mimicks replacing all of the cartridges at once .
i can not speak specifically to the artisan 800 , but the cis has a set of 6 tubes that run from the cartridges to the tanks . most users report that their printer will not close , and they use something such as a piece of cardboard to insert in the hole that senses whether the lid is closed , to fool the machine . a few report using a dremel tool to grind down the chassis about 3 16 '' in one spot in order accommodate the tubes and allow the lid to close . i hope that someone can answer your specific question . some of the reviews provide a lot of information , particularly the one by eric in july . i can not speak specifically to the artisan 800 , but the cis has a set of 6 tubes that run from the cartridges to the tanks . most users report that their printer will not close , and they use something such as a piece of cardboard to insert in the hole that senses whether the lid is closed , to fool the machine . a few report using a dremel tool to grind down the chassis about 3 16 '' in one spot in order accommodate the tubes and allow the lid to close . i hope that someone can answer your specific question . some of the reviews provide a lot of information , particularly the one by eric in july .

yes , the screen is backlit . and , it is battery powered . it does not need to be recharged . however , you can use either rechargeable batteries you charge yourself or regular batteries . it has settings for both .
it only contains several themed groups of conversational phrases . for translating your own phrases you need translator or app that connects to a translator on the net . eg . spanish anywhere .
the definitions are good but the lyrics are too small .
ordinary triple a batteries .

no no no quick book is a expensive software that you have to upgrade every year . sorry
yes , that is what is required per the manual . the least expensive we 've found is walmart .
plastic
yes it will work . just as long as they use not so many different types of paper . make sure they set the default to blacke and white only when printing if they do not need color .
no.. but it can be by plugging it into a wireless router . that 's what i did .
the one we received only has 1 paper tray . i will say that we have had zero issues with this printer and use it in an office with 8 employees who print on a regular , fairly heavy basis . it has been a workhorse .
i do not know

16 1 2 '' across10 '' front to back
pretty sure it 's metal , very sturdy ! have had it for two years and neck pain is all gone !
its 21 inches wide
it says made in taiwan on the shipping box .
depends on how you adjust the legs . i dont use it at all anymore . it is hard to adjust and can not beadjusted to sit on your lap or used in bed . too hard to figure out , to adjust .
my 17 '' fits fine
it would work well for that also .
no , i have n't had that problem in two orders .
absolutely yes . we bought these replacement cazters for four of our chairs which are used on both hardwood and laminate flooring and they have performed perfectly without even the slightest maring . excellent product and highly recommended . dave at 1scotsman @ sequimbay.net .
no , none of them have brakes .
i do n't believe so . in the chair these casters fit , there is a blind socket in which the stem fits and it is held in place by a small snap ring on the stem .
i also have an ikea chair . these were too big . for some reason my chair has a 10mm diameter making the 'universal ' ones too big .
i would have to say yes . i 'm using them on hardwood floor and i feel that i have to use some effort to slide around in my chair .
make sure that you can drill 7 16 '' on the bottom of the leg 's and that it wo n't weaken them . then follow the easy to do instructions . hope this is helpful .
if the wheel is sitting on a flat surface and standing up , the height is exactly 2 and 11 16 inches from top to bottom . the stem itself is 7 8 inches long . the wheel diameter is exactly 2 inches . but these particular casters did not hold up because the rubber wheel is supported only by a cheap plastic axle , poorly constructed ; they would break easy ; so i ended up putting back on the replaced hard plastic wheel castors which had stronger axle support .
once you select print , the print window opens , select preferences , then click paper quality , then click advanced options icon that is on the bottom right , under printer features click output quality and select fast draft . hope this helps .
if you print a couple pages a day you will be buying ink every few weeks . it drains it . i have had many hp printers and never has one used ink the way this one does .
yes . you can download the software online on the hp website .
i had same exact problem , office max told me printer heads need cleaned . you have to take it semi apart to pull out heads.. very frustrating..
set the print mode under printing defaults . printer properties , advanced tab , printing defaults button . once you apply , or save the settings , it will stay that way .

since the 1430 is not a scanner i assume you want to know how large an image can be printed . the width limit is 13 inches , but lengthwise it will print panoramas that are quite long . i have some prints ( using rolled paper ) that are 44 inches long ( i.e.13 '' x 44 '' ) . most of my large prints are typically 11 x 17 or 13 x 19 , or in that general range ( depending on crop ) as these are more common paper sizes.hope this helps .
i am able to print beautiful 13 x 19 prints with this printer . i only use epson paper and inks . they frame well and are archival . i love this printer except for smaller sized paper which does not feed reliably . i thinbk you should be satisfied with the quality of the work it produces .
we have 2 of these printers . one is 2 years old and we 've never had a maintenance issue . they both have been good printers .
the epson 1430 does an excellent and fast job printing regular text .
i have three of them it is a professional printer ... it is great ... buy a scanner they are cheap ... ... you do n't want all of that stuff on a printer..you would get better results with a epson scanner ... .the scanner has more features ...
i 'm not a photographer either . i use it to print design pieces and it works great . i recommend buying the cable for more reliable printing . you 'll need it anyway for set up .
version 11 came with mine
no
yes
usb . as far as i know it does n't work wirelessly . if it does i have n't discovered that option yet .
you just keep scanning your doc and do not hit done scanning until you have scanned in your last doc . the entire multi page doc will show up on your screen
powered by usb . no wifi - direct connect to a single computer .
kate , no the lid does not come off . it 's work great !
i ca n't say for sure . the lid is hinged externally so it may be possible to remove it . you might get in touch with the xerox one-touch people for a better answer . i found them to be very helpful when i was setting up my unit..
yes , hp & epson are generally both built that way , not sure about other brands . not sure about the capacity , will see if i can dig out that info .
yes , it 's very reliable and has excellent print quality .
yes it will print card stock with no problem .
yes it does
it prints two-sided automatically once two-sided printing selected under printer properties .
yes , there are toner cartridges with the printer .
unfortunately it only does pdf and jpg ... as per manual . to confirm i tried pdf , jpg , docx , and doc ... only pdf and jpg worked .
the m475dn is not wireless . you probably want the m475dw which has the wireless option
no . i presume documents with lots of graphics can benefit from extra memory . i never had a need for it .
you have to play with them as you install ... pull the premounted rails out , make sure you are setting the drawer rails level , and sliding past the plastic lockers ... .then it 's in when you can push them all the way back .
no .
it 's solid and heavy . it will hold full drawers of paper , i probably wouldnt store your rock collection in it . ( damn it marie , they 're minerals )
no
just pick up the phone and make that call i used it on an epson printer that uses pigment based ink prior to use i was told save your time and money toss it buy a new one well the printer worked once again it was a2400 which is quite old but down the road i bought another printer but do have a bottle of this cherry in a safe place
i do n't know if it will work for you but this item did not work at all for me .
i do n't know . contact the place where you bought it . they may be able to help you .
do n't know but instructions will have you guessing until the polar ice cap melts ...
i 'm sorry you are having problems with your printer . i strongly suggest you contact a reputable canon printer representative to check your printer for printerhead problems . have a wonderful year !
it did not work for me either . if you have an epson printer and you do n't use is much , i doubt it will work . there are printers that do n't have that problem . i was told a cannon and that is what i got to replace my epson printer and so far no problems . i liked where you can buy the three colors separately with epson , but if you do n't use the printer on a regular basis it creates a problem . if you are looking to fix an epson printer with this cleaner , do n't waste your money .
i do n't see why it would n't . just follow the instructions . there should also be a video on how to identify the print heads on an epson printer .
it 's 11.5 inches at the tallest point .
yes , it will hold file folders . i place letter size file folders in mine .
each pocket is about 12 '' wide x 2 '' deep x 8 '' high
i have not had that problem .
they are most likely strong enough unless you are putting stuff in them that is too heavy in the first place . as for stacking , that 's a great idea , but not sure if they will stay stacked-unless you wire them together .
i do n't see why not . the paper holders are a few inches wider than the paper , so it might look a bit funny , but it 'll work .
no , it is not magnetic . it is just metal mesh .
that would depend on the size of the checkbook . i would n't hesitate to shred the check registers that i use , but the `` checkbook '' you are referring to may be different from a check register .
i ca n't give you the percentage but the quick answer is yes , more so if you do n't bag it and empty the shredded paper into 'recycle ' bin .
i just measured it with the wheels ... .. it stands 25½ '' high , 15½ '' wide and 12½ '' deep .
all you have to do is buy the shredder lubricant sheet 12 pack use this for your shredder you stick in in just like you would a pice of papper and they really work . it has the oil on the sheets and it is no miss good luck it is called aleratec shredder lubricant sheet 12-pack
i agree with jeff mccomb 's answer on august 19 , 2014 , `` its a tad wider than a 8 1 2 sheet of paper -- -- but it will accept a number of sheets of paper ''
yes , considering what this shredder is capable of , very quiet .
so far its never overheated . this thing is by far the best shredder on the market . i can put 15 pages in together and it never slows down .
very small . very good shredder
i had one very serious jam and i made sure that the shredder was turned off and unplugged from the surge protector and then used several pliers in different lengths and pulled the paper from it . after i cleared the jam i put some performance oil on a single sheet of paper and ran it through and it worked okay .
no , it does not have a tray or anything to hold items to be shredded . it shred 's so good that you do n't need to save or hold items for more than a few minutes depending on volume to be shredded . i had the unit for a few weeks and now my junk mail does n't pile up at all . i have been able to feed the junk mail to shredder whole , thus far .
good question ; according to the cable service wow , it is and it is not their problem . it is the phone .
i am not sure , but i think you can use it without the landline service . i would call panasonic and ask . they are very helpful . i have it hooked up to a service , just so you know .
the link between the base and your cellphone is done via bluetooth . most old flip phones do n't have bluetooth ... but if yours does , it should work .
press the mute button .
i think so . i was able to sync my cell phone to the panasonic landline . kathryn
i use it with my house current , 110. do n't know about abroad or any higher voltage . hope this helps .
yes you can call out using your cell phone . i use my cell service all the time to call out . works very good .
no , this phone don´t do this .
i am 6-2 '' 195lbs and this is the chair i use . it fits great and i have my feet up all the time !
they can be removed without causing any problems . you just have to turn a knob under each arm and they will come right off . you can also just skip the step installing them without harming the chair .
yes , it will lean back . it has three positions you can lock it in ( full upright approx 15 degrees approx 30 degrees ) or leave it unlocked and use the spring tensioner for support.. the tension on the seat-back mechanism is enough to give some support and will also assist you when you wish to return to full upright . the locking mechanism is easily accessed and works well . at 230 lbs and 6ft tall i am able to use this chair with confidence .
yeah i believe the 205 is the newer model . not really sure why it 's cheaper but i wo n't complain . it is a great chair . the adjustments are seat height , sliding the seat forwards and backwards , and you can lock the back into a few angled positions . there is also tilt tension on the bottom .
the minimum height of the arms is 25.5 '' with the seat at 18 '' to a max of 31.5 '' at 21.5 '' . the arms adjust from 7 '' to 10 '' above the seat . the seat adjusts from 18 '' to 21.5 '' from floor . the back extends to the top of my shoulders . i recommend this chair .
at the manufacturer website ( http : lorellfurniture.com products ? id=1021069631 ) it has : high-back mesh chair offers a mesh back and seat with plastic-coated steel frame . arms with polyurethane arm pads adjust in height and width . functions include pneumatic seat-height adjustment , seat-glide mechanism , 360-degree swivel , tilt tension and synchronized knee tilt . high-back chair meets the ca117 fire-retardant standard .
the chair arms are rubber so they are squishy ... but not quite `` padded '' . the arms almost sit too far back or need to be a little bit longer forwared . overall the arms are comfortable . i 've purchased 4 of them for the office and they are liked by the employees . i 'll be purchasing more in the future .
approximately 24 '' from top of seat cushion to top of the back .
it 's a different model . this version ( llr86205 ) has a seat glide function , meaning you can slide the seat forward or backward independently of the back . it also has a tilt tension adjustment . see here- http : content.etilize.com assembly-instructions 1021069631.pdfthe llr86200 has seat tilt only , no glide slide . and no tension adjustment . see here- http : content.etilize.com assembly-instructions 1010046297.pdf

no
i have had no problems with the printer once i downloaded the current driver from hp . normally the drivers that come with the device are out of date by the time that the devices are produced , packed , and shipped . i never load from the install disk provided . go to the hp support website type in your model number and serial number and you will find the newest drives . download them and install them . good luck !
yes . the d in the model number indicates duplexing ( n indicates that it can be networked ) .
i have this printer and love it ! but it is just a printer and to my knowledge , it does not scan pages . it will automatically print on both sides ( it does this very well ) , but if you discover how to make it scan i would be interested to learn how .
no , it does n't , unfortunately . the paper cassette ( tray 2 ) holds 250 sheets and the mp tray ( tray 1 ) 50. there is an optional 500-sheet cassette that can be added . get complete specs in the data sheet at http : www.hp.com hpinfo newsroom press_kits 2012 ppsinfluencersummit2012 hplaserjet_m401.pdf .
i have n't experienced this problem with heavier stock , per se , but i have had a problem with larger envelopes , specifically 6x9 , which the printer apparently does n't recognize as envelopes , and with labels when it does n't know they 're labels . this can be avoided by opening the printer properties to the printing shortcuts tab and selecting `` envelope '' or `` label '' as the paper type .
the light ( when it works ) is a bluish-purple , but it works because it emits ultraviolet light . pure uv is invisible to the naked eye .
5,25
yes , as pictured , they are in individual packaging
my kids have done so . they report that it does work and it does not sting . they are loving these for all sorts of things .
yes the ink is clear and yes any black light will work . it comes with a light attached to pen . they are pretty cool little pens . kids love them .
these are markers , you can not see anything on the paper ( maybe slightly damp , but it dries ) until you shine the blacklight on it .
i got mine in october & it glows the same as it did back 5 months ago
if you left the cap off it dries up and does n't work .
it would be the base station that has the answer and transmitter components in it .
yes
i 'm not sure . i added one without much difficulty . you may need to check with panasonic to see what the limit would be .
yes ! the base that charges the unit needs it . : )
yes it comes with the charging base . i bought this phone to add to my order of the answering machine w 3 phones .
yes , it does . both the base and all the satellite pods have speaker phone feature .
it worked for me . now i finally have a portable phone for my workbench in the garage !
no . it is not possible and they have no intention of doing so .
yes you can ! you can print 4 2x3 photos on 4x6 media or 5x7 media . they fit perfectly into 2 '' x 2-7 8 '' keychains from neil enterprises .
yes , for 4x6 you use 2upc-c14 and for 5x7 you use 2upc-c15
no ! it translates any image sent to it as a 5x7 .
you buy media that is 4x6 or 5x7 . you can print these sizes or anything smaller ( like wallet size prints ) . the 4x6 media is 2upcc14 and the 5x7 media is upcr10l . if you have any more questions please call martin , our in-house snap-lab expert at 1-800-621-5584. he 'd be happy to answer any more questions you may have and get you a deal on a printer , media , and photo keychains to go with !
hi georgia , it can print 2x8 photo strips . you need to download an upgrade to the snaplab software which is free . you also need to buy 2upcc48pf media . it prints 2 photo strips at a time .
no , it did n't have a glossy side ... .. great weight for packing though .
yes , great for packing . no ink .
like the others , i do n't know . as a printer ( for 35 years ) i would say that if it was recycled , they would have advertised it as such . paper companies are big on that nowadays .
the boxes i received did not include partitions . -- kmvictorian
yes , cecilia , that means 4 boxes .
no , its just a big empty box . you
yes it does ... it does n't always get the name right , especially bogus 800 numbers or people selling you `` siding '' but it does announce what it has as information on the number thats calling you ... kinda cool ... allows you to let it go to vmail if you dont like to answer it ... oh ... only announces from the base ... the handsets show the number and information , handsets dont announce out loud ... i hope this clarifies your question ...
dont know never really paid attention
i do n't know because i do not store names numbers - i do know it has the best reception of any phone i have had - it has great distance reception for larger homes spaces - i highly recommend this phone !
no
hard
you can record any voice to answer . also , the announced caller is a great feature , but it is the robotic voice . hope this helps .
if you follow the instructions , it is very simple
hi yes the new machine will come with everything but the printer cable you might need in some situations in setting it up . however the first set of ink is like 1 4 the fill of standard ink cartridges i do suggest you consider getting your refills right away . that being said the main reason i personally chose brother is that it will accept generic filled ink cartridges without all this special bar code stuff other machines do to insure you only are using their brand . so go ahead and buy generic works great for me .
nope ! you will have to print all odd pages then reload it and print all even pages in other to get double sided prints .
yes . but you must download the updated firmware for the printer . not too hard just follow the brothers website instructions .
this printer is a `` all-in-one '' unit . very easy setup . it uses a system of 4 ink cartridges and you only replace the one you are low on . i buy my ink refills for this printerthrough abacus -- www.private.abacus24-7.com -- for under $ 2.00 each and it includes free shipping . printer is a good value .
15 x 15
paper is loaded in a tray in the front of the printer . it pulls straight out , top lifted and paper loaded , then slide tray back in . the tray must be able to be pulled out at least 8-9 inches to be properly loaded . hope this helps !
you just need to know the printer model number . i bought replacement ink on amazon as well . the best part of this printer is you can get generic ink-you do n't have to buy the 'brother ' brand which is common with other brands , so your ink costs will be much lower .
this decidedly ac with a 6-7-foot cord . other inquirers have asked about the on off toggle switch which is located at the lower right ( facing front ) back of the machine . the only jams i have encountered are when things like buttons , tokens , half dollars , dollar coins , foreign coins ( even canadian ) and bent pennies have slipped in in bags of coins . yesterday i sorted and `` rolled '' $ 89 in less than 1 2 hour . this sorter beats any of the others i 've used - either battery or ac .
candace , the royal sovereign qs-1ac is electric cord operated . no batteries required .
this machine will not auto wrap the correct amount of coins per sleeve .
it does miss coins in the stack ( even if it does n't run out ! ) . we use it only to sort the coins but then we stack them manually ( we have another device ) to make sure there is the proper amount . just as my review stated , we were disappointed .
it works with quarters , dimes , nickels , and pennies . as far as other foreign currencies , i have no idea .
you can buy special coin wrappers that are designed to be placed in the hoppers for the coins to fall into . do n't try to do that with the old style wrappers , it just does n't work . charlie .
yes they can be sorted without rappers . yes plastic tubes are included .
i have owned mfc8910dw for 3 months now and am very pleased with the scanning performance . the scanning is very quick , and the feeder works great for multiple pages , either for one side or dual side . the scan rate slows down if you want higher resolution or color , but for my general purpose application where text is of interest , the rate is very quick ( dont remember the dpi , 150x150 i think ) . the iphone app works very well too , the only complaint i have is that the app does not have option for dual page . the wireless works flawlessly as well.in general , i am very happy with this printer . i have owned mfc8910dw for 3 months now and am very pleased with the scanning performance . the scanning is very quick , and the feeder works great for multiple pages , either for one side or dual side . the scan rate slows down if you want higher resolution or color , but for my general purpose application where text is of interest , the rate is very quick ( dont remember the dpi , 150x150 i think ) . the iphone app works very well too , the only complaint i have is that the app does not have option for dual page . the wireless works flawlessly as well.in general , i am very happy with this ... » read more i have owned mfc8910dw for 3 months now and am very pleased with the scanning performance . the scanning is very quick , and the feeder works great for multiple pages , either for one side or dual side . the scan rate slows down if you want higher resolution or color , but for my general purpose application where text is of interest , the rate is very quick ( dont remember the dpi , 150x150 i think ) . the iphone app works very well too , the only complaint i have is that the app does not have option for dual page . the wireless works flawlessly as well.in general , i am very happy with this printer . « show less
no you will either tn720 or tn750 .
yes ! both as full page our as booklet .
i ca n't answer that question but i can say i work with sensitive documents . i ca n't afford to have unclear images . this brother 's product has met my high expectations . i have no complaints .
yes , it 'll scan , copy , fax all without internet .
the mfc 9810dw is sold with the lower capacity toner cartridge which i think was the tn720 . the print quality is very good . i recall the tn720 only produced about 2,000 printed pages of mostly text when it ran out of toner ; which is less than its rated life . the tn750 i have is still going strong after over 8.000 pages . i picked the mfc8910dw for its automatic dual sided scanning and do much more scanning than printing to unload file cabinets .
yes it can scan directly to an e-mail address .
absolutley , its a great standalone . i have it on wireless and my computer is networked to it . i do all my scanning through the computer using there software . but it is fine as a standalone . i have 3 of these printers
although i love the winsome cambridge lap and bed desk as a `` breakfast in bed '' tray , i do n't think it would be sturdy enough to support the weight and usage of a mounted keyboard tray . the main horizontal piece ( the `` table '' part of it , if you will ) is movable ; it can be set at an angle and used to hold books for comfortable reading in bed . this piece of wood is approximately 1 3 - 1 2 inch thick , too thin i think to bolt anything to . lastly , the legs of the table are rounded at the `` feet '' , and if i have too much weight on the top of the tray , the whole unit starts to bow because the feet do n't have a lot of grip to the surface the tray is sitting on ( usually my bed ) . hope this is helpful . although i love the winsome cambridge lap and bed desk as a `` breakfast in bed '' tray , i do n't think it would be sturdy enough to support the weight and usage of a mounted keyboard tray . the main horizontal piece ( the `` table '' part of it , if you will ) is movable ; it can be set at an angle and used to hold books for comfortable reading in bed . this piece of wood is approximately 1 3 - 1 2 inch thick , too thin i think to bolt anything to . lastly , the legs of the table are rounded at the `` feet '' , and if i have too much weight on the top of the tray , the whole unit ... » read more although i love the winsome cambridge lap and bed desk as a `` breakfast in bed '' tray , i do n't think it would be sturdy enough to support the weight and usage of a mounted keyboard tray . the main horizontal piece ( the `` table '' part of it , if you will ) is movable ; it can be set at an angle and used to hold books for comfortable reading in bed . this piece of wood is approximately 1 3 - 1 2 inch thick , too thin i think to bolt anything to . lastly , the legs of the table are rounded at the `` feet '' , and if i have too much weight on the top of the tray , the whole unit starts to bow because the feet do n't have a lot of grip to the surface the tray is sitting on ( usually my bed ) . hope this is helpful . « show less
i actually believe it can .
i purchased it for my grandson who is 12. he has no problem lifting it ... i hope that helps ... i do n't think its heavy at all .
i do n't understand why you think it needs screws . i did n't have to assemble anything .
29 '' 15x9 '' i love mine , bought it a while back , onefor my mother also , , like the side `` pockets '' good for books paper pencil etc . the face board lifts so that it can be set at an angle for easy reading etc . i like that its made of wood , im tired of stuff made of plastic , altho its good to recycle .it fits under my bed too
the solid table surface is 16 & 1 2 inches side to side , and 15 & 1 4 inches top to bottom .
i sent the tray back so i do n't remember but it was a very nice size tray and would be perfect for a breakfast tray . i was going to use it for my laptop during recovery from surgery but i could n't adjust the height so it was n't useful for what i wanted it for . but i can say that i definitely would 've kept it had i needed it for just a breakfast tray . the finish was beautiful , it was sturdy and the size was very adequate . i 'm sorry that i could n't give you the answer but i hope what i 've given you is enough to help you in making your decision . good luck .
it depends on the weight of the tv , which i do n't know . i would not put anything heavier than about fifteen pounds on it . also , assemble it carefully and be sure all screws are tight before you put anything valuable on it .
i have had no problems on putting pressure on the glass . the scanner worked properly . i returned the a3 1200s scanner ( doa ) & purchased the a3 2400s - a little more expensive , so my observations are for the a3 2400s model . it should be ok though - same design.the only other observation i can make is that the objects must be flat - the depth of field for these type scanners , as opposed to the ccd type devices , which are at least three times as expensive , is nonexistent . but for flat objects it 's just fine - and fast .
no - the glass is set into a plastic frame about 1 8 of an inch deep - like the glass in a picture frame
i do n't know about 10.9.4. however , it works well with 10.8.5 without having to go thru photoshop .
this scanner will scan 11 inch by 17 inch on a flat bed . note it does n't have a document feeder . i use if for scanning old photo albums and scrapbooks which are approximately 11x17 . if is also good for scanning sheet music which is tyically larger that 8.5x11 .
the scanning software has an output function which will enable you to change the final size of the scanned image.you can also use photo-editing software to reduce the image and or crop it to your desired size.al g
it did not work on my mac , which is only one year old . it has something to do with the software not allowing it to communicate with the driver for the scanner . i tried everything to make it work . i ended up going and buying a windows laptop so that i could use the scanner . it was very easy to connect to the laptop , windows 8 .
depends on the margin . to test , i scanned a ruler , and it appears to have gotten 11 3 4 inches . close !
yes , install the provided windows 7 drivers , install first before connecting the scanner . i love this scanner and recommend it highly
i did n't even check to see where the pen was made but i use my pens every day and one of the pens does not meet the quality that i have come to expect from cross . the click on one pen has raised above the normal position to the where the tip of the ink is recesed and soon i wo n't be able to use it . have n't had time to return it . i have only had it a couple of weeks
the cross click gel refill . period .
it 's very slim so i think it would be fine .
based on picture on the back of the package , it appears they will but since i lost a part of my original cross pen , ca n't test it
grab the top with one hand and the bottom with the other and pull like crazy . i found the entire design quite below cross ' normal quality plus they did not write smoothly . sort of like writing on a rough surface covered with elmer 's glue with a dull pencil .
i have ordered them from cross.com . i have also found the refills at office max so when i find them i order as lot ! i love my gel pen and have to keep a close watch on it as it had a tendency to `` sprout feet '' and walk to other folks hands .
more like a boxy tube . for what it 's worth : it 's a pretty good pen . if you can modify a standard parker refill ( study it and you 'll figure a way ) , you 'll have a better refill and a much better pen .

i use the internal memory and then transfer the saved scans to a flash drive .
it will scan a laminated social security card and it will scan up to up to a 8x10 . i scanned my driver 's licence so it should scan id cards
the one i bought would work with chrome if you plugged the usb into the scanner , scanned and then walked over to the computer with chrome plugged the memory stick in and uploaded it . so i guess it depends on what your definition of wireless is .
no , it scans and saves each page separately .
it only scans one side st a time .
yes it does
picture are fairly accurate - although can vary dependent upon your computer screen reolsution
i 'm sorry but i never had to , they were perfect out of the box for our waiting room . going on 3 years now and they are still going strong . hope that helps but we never added casters .

yes , very well . my wife and i have an imac and a macbook pro - originally ran os x 10.6.x and now are running os x mavericks ( 10.9 ) . the epson workforce wf-3520 works with them perfectly , both directly attached and wirelessly . the scanner and printing features , like the double-sided printing , work without any trouble or hassle . the only thing we have n't tried is faxing because our home business does things electronically ( such as pdfs ) instead of faxes .
i have found the scanner to be every bit as good as a hp5p that i have previousy used for color family photographs . it has high resolution which allows enlargement of smaller photographs with high quality resulis . it is so handy to use , i never use the hp any more . i might add that the scanning software included is excellent . wendell hanson
i have the workforce 845 , and all you have to do is click the `` add page '' button after it scans and you can scan additional documents from any source . not sure if the 3520 works the same , but it would be silly if it did n't .
this printer will print `` acceptable '' photos on good quality photo paper . color rendition is good for snapshots , but never for archival or media production photos . you are getting what you pay for . if it is high quality you need , you will need a much more expensive printer .
approximately 385 pages . i usually print in black and white so i buy the double black cartridge . when i do print in color it does come out beautifully .
the wf 3520 about 18 inches wide and 10 inches high ( you will need room to open the top cover ) . the depth is about 17 inches but you need clearance for the power cord in the back
i have n't had to use customer support yet . all instructions have been easy for setup . so far , i have run low on only one cartridge , the black one . the printer asked if i wanted to use a combination of the other colors in order to obtain the black and i responded yes and the print continued . i thought that was quite neat !
yes , you definitely can , though the machine will recognize them as generic , and ask if youwant to proceed with the set up , which you simply answer yes , or click ok , or somethingsimilar .
it measures 34 '' with the wheels attached . it 's a great cart . lightweight but does heavyweight work .
do the specs show what the max wt would be ? we use this at work for a laptop and printerit gets around nice.i am just not sure about drink cooler ... sorry
i would not
hi there , the lip on the top shelf measures 2 inches . thank you ! trinity
the distance from the bottom of the top shelf to the lip on the bottom shelf is 23 '' and the distance from the bottom of the top shelf to the surface of the bottom is about 25. hope this helps you ... ... it is a dandy cart !
you get one slide film tray and one negative film tray . i did buy two extra slide trays at the same time . that speeded up the whole process .
my slides are all mounted , some with cardboard , really old ones with some type of metal . in any event , you need to use the tray in order to scan them . the opening for each slide in the tray is 1.5 x 1. the inside measurement where the slid sits is 2 x 2. i hope this helps .
i believe only to a card ... it worked well !
when i received this item , i only received 2 trays , not the 5 advertised . i contacted amazon who contacted the seller and they sent me the additional trays . so i ended up with the 5 trays advertised .
i used it to refill the starter toner cartridge that came with the printer . one bottle filled that cartridge . note : you will need to also replace the chip ( cost about $ 15 ) . i google searched for instructions online ( found a good youtube demonstration video ) .
it should , but if i recommend it is another question .
it works for my samsung ml-2160 . sol corp should have a compatibility list .
no to changing the chip . have had several times where the printer told me i was out of toner , but it printed anyway . my printer is a samsung ml-2165w .
jean , that part is approximately 9.5 inches deep and 19.5 inches across . i bought this mat in march , 2014 .
it has a bevelled edge , so hard to get an exact without calipers , but approximately 1 8 '' across surface ; bevel is approximately 1 16 '' at edges .
19 1 2 inches wide by 9 1 2 inches high . note : the 9 1 2 inch lip is included in the 48 inch height .
we 're currently using it with short ( 1 4 ) pile and it works great .
mine ordered 5 12 2014 and delivered 5 13 2014 was shipped rolled in a box about 1 sq . ft on ends , and the memory effect is very pronounced . if i can not easily flatten it , it 's going back .
the mat is tapered , so there is less of a chance to trip on the edge . i am getting older and it seems to work for me , better than the old squared off mat .

the true dimension is approx . 35.5 '' wide x 37.5 '' deep with a 10 '' x 20 '' lip added to the 37.5 depth for a total depth of 47.5 '' . hope this helps !

if the laptop has windows 7 , or windows 8 ( or 8.1 ) and has a usb port ( or you can connect it to your network ) , then yes it is .
yes ... . it prints both sides ... u have to set it when ready to print ... . i love this printer !
yes , it comes with black , yellow , red , and blue catridges .
hi . it seams to last a fairly long time , compared to past printers i 've owned .
it does n't come with the charger . it has a usb port to plug in and charge . we have an iphone 4 and 5 and a an android and works out great for us .
the measurements are : 20 inches wide ( inside the two legs ) 2 3 4 inches high an 8 1 4 inch deep .

yes it will but but but i returned mine because the usbs didnt work on it and ended up getting a design similar without usbs called iboard also was cheaper works fine with my 27in imac and i love it ...
well.. i use this for my imac 27 '' and it works and looks great .
hi . the stand gets all its usb power from the computer . there 's no separate power supply . however , that said , i 've connected wd passport drives and an htc android phone to it and did n't have any problems with lack of power . usually , unpowered hubs do n't have enough *oomph* to keep an external drive going , but this one does very well .
it does not , the glass stand is very sturdy & will hold a 27 '' monitor with no problem ; i have one 27 '' dell . the only minus aspect is that when you put the monitor in top of the stand , you need a bit taller to have a direct eyesight ... .
great question . i apologize for the mistake , but it 's best to peel cold . once the transfer is complete await a few minutes and peel the parchment sheet from the transfer . all dark transfer products on the market are cold peel .
yes it does , i 've placed it on leather . it does n't look good nor will it last long . to me , vinyl or patches look better . yet ! customer 's that i have still want it . it 's like a one time wear for most . some will come back to have me remove it after an event.hope that helped you .
it last about three months .
this is right off of canons forum : the standard cli-251 series ink tanks contain 7ml of ink while cli-251 xl series contain 11ml of ink .
yes
yes . i have a ink box of cli 251 inks and on the side of the box it says it compatible with your printer . these are the same size of cartridge , they just have a lot more ink . well worth the value , these are all that i use . good choice . jim
yes , they are the same shape , they just have more ink in them .
hello , natalia -- i really ca n't relate to that experience , as , i 've always had good luck and no problems with ordering the correct inks , no matter the model of printer . i 've bought several printers via amazon over the past ten years and it 's been the same just-right experience , each time -- including the follow-up inks . i always buy the factory suggested , true ink -- no refills knock-offs , ever , by-the-way . never have ink printing problems , either . i wish i could give you a hint as to why you are experiencing anything other than perfect satisfaction in your ink-to-printer purchases .
i have a canon pixma 922 that uses these ink cartridges : cli-251 black ( reg or xl ) , cli-251 magenta ( reg or xl ) , cli-251 yellow ( reg or xl ) , cli-251 cyan ( reg or xl ) -- must use all regular or all xl ... plus pgi-250 black ( pgbk 250 is the larger black cartridge ) -- can opt to use regular or xl independent of the other 4 cartridges . note that the xl cartridges hold more ink and are more cost-effective .
yes , we use these rolls with the tsp100s . the tsp100s support 3-1 8 '' width paper rolls , up to 273 ' length .
yes.this paper will work on citizen ct-310ii models .
that printer says it has a width rangetype thermal paperwidth 1.97 '' -3.25 '' if that 's true the 3 1 8 width world work
it fit in mine . i 'm not sure what model . but it 's an epson front loading machine .
i 'm sorry do n't know that answer . maybe you can call epson and ask their 800 #
yes it should work just fine . thanks !
diameter is over 70mm
yes
yes , it does , i sometimes have a hard time with the door card reader staying in place . i have to move it around until it stops saying door open . other than that it works fine . i have n't bought any more ink yet . i 've had this for at least 6 months . really saving on ink .
sorry , i ca n't answer that . i got it on special . mine is in a box still . after i get moved and all is unboxed i will use it then . sorry i was n't able to help .
we bought this ink : 20 oz . ( 600 ml ) jumbo printer ink cartridge refill kit color & black
i am sorry i ca n't answer that because i have n't used yet . i got when it was on sale . i hoped to have used , but have n't run out of other ink yet .
the base can be inserted between horizontal layers of the bed , i.e. , between matteress & box springs , between springs and frame ( slats ) . it does n't have to rest on the floor .
the width is adequate for an average laptop .
i wish i could help but i did n't buy this table . i do n't know why amazon thinks i did . the one i bought was a little fancier . sorry again .
i bought this item.. it came broken . when i did get one , it was very unstable and does not swivel safely . sorry , but i would not recommend this item to anyone .
yes you can but it is n't strong enough . actually i found at wallmart a simillar one and it is stronger for only 14 $ .
yes you can , but this tray is not stable enough to guarantee that the items on it will not slide off . it 's pretty flimsy but it does help to hold things up for temporary use .
this picture does not show `` epson '' on the cartridge , so i would doubt that it is oem . my cartridges all have epson on each side of the cartridge .
why not ask epson ?
the 200xl prints about 2.5 times more pages then the 200. approx 200 pages for the 200 and 500 for the 200xl .
first cartridge lasted less than a week . second cartridge printed one good printout . the second printout said `` replace cartridge '' .
this box contains one ( 1 ) high yield epson 200 black cartridge . usually high yield cartridges would offer significant benefit compared to a regular capacity or economy cartridge . xl represents extra high yield .
yes , the size of the memory does not matter , it the physical size of the card .
yes , just remove the hand wand from the dock , turn on , and roll over page or picture .
both . the batteries make it portable , but you can use the adapter if you do n't want to drain the batteries .
yes it does create a searchable pdf . you can use the handheld scanner and or have it hooked directly to computer . when hooked up , look under start on your screen , go to computer and it will show up under one of the disk drive ports . then you can save it to documents or desktop or whatever .
sorry i have not used fiskar 's .
no it does n't have a cover and i tried porting it along ... it did not work well
to date , the lightest weight paper i used was standard notebook paper and none of the colors bled . not even close . one con i discovered was that card stock , using dark heavier weighted papers absorb the ink . i ended up ordering the the jelly writers flourescent orange and pink . the ink consistancy is thicker and does n't not disappear into the paper . but i am still loving the pens ! i have used them so much i emptied 10 of the pens and most will be out soon . i will be ordering more .
i do n't have any black paper to try it on . i do have a very dark , dark green folder that is made of paper ( not the plastic or shiny kind ) and it did write on that color . of course the darker colors do n't show up as well . the lighter ones do show up better , as do the metallic colors . but yes , they do technically write on black paper .
hmmm ... .never thought of that , but i tried it and no go - this type of gel is water soluble .
i suppose it depends on how much and how often u use them ... .i do n't use mine exclusively i have all different kinds , but i have n't run out of ink on any of them ... i love the sparkly purple color and have used them for hours at a time and they have gone down in ink but not a lot at all ... hope this helps ...
the stand minus the pens is 8 inches wide , 4 inches deep , 5 1 2 inches tall
i would think so . it seems very sturdy and well made . i have to say i am impressed at how solid it is and the quality of the mechanism that raises the unit up and lowers it back down . i have been very happy with this product and have recommended it to several people .
there are set points but all work well for me . i am 5 foot on the nose . i love my veridesk , wish i had a second one for at home .

do you mean for security or just so they do n't move ? i have not needed to secure them . they just stay on the shelf ... maybe some earthquake putty if you find it is slippery.if it is to prevent theft - i do n't know .
the keyboard does not rise with the desk but the surface that does rise seems to have plenty of room to accomodate .
no
yes , that 's probably about right .
i think the answer is yes *if* you could lay the modem or storage down sideways or flat . i 'm not in front of it right now but i would guess there is about 5-6 inches ( 13-15 cm ) of space .
it has a flashing red light on the base station . you can also see on headset how many messages .
it works well . you can encounter issues when you have your cell phone connected via bluetooth if your phone is more than about 30 feet from the base unit . for us that is pretty good because we have a floor and multiple walls in between . without obstruction you could easily get more than 50-60 feet . if your cell phone is close to the base , then it sounds just like a normal phone call over a speaker phone . generally it is the quality of the cell phone that is more the issue . we live were we are lucky to get more than one bar . generally the speaker mode of the handset is better than the cell phone in non speaker phone mode much less speakerphone mode . so you should n't find issue with speaker phone . i have conducted several conference calls using speakerphone mode over both landline and cellphones using speakerphone mode of the handset . it works well . you can encounter issues when you have your cell phone connected via bluetooth if your phone is more than about 30 feet from the base unit . for us that is pretty good because we have a floor and multiple walls in between . without obstruction you could easily get more than 50-60 feet . if your cell phone is close to the base , then it sounds just like a normal phone call over a speaker phone . generally it is the quality of the cell phone that is more the issue . we live were we are lucky to get more than one bar . generally the speaker mode of the handset is better than the cell ... » read more it works well . you can encounter issues when you have your cell phone connected via bluetooth if your phone is more than about 30 feet from the base unit . for us that is pretty good because we have a floor and multiple walls in between . without obstruction you could easily get more than 50-60 feet . if your cell phone is close to the base , then it sounds just like a normal phone call over a speaker phone . generally it is the quality of the cell phone that is more the issue . we live were we are lucky to get more than one bar . generally the speaker mode of the handset is better than the cell phone in non speaker phone mode much less speakerphone mode . so you should n't find issue with speaker phone . i have conducted several conference calls using speakerphone mode over both landline and cellphones using speakerphone mode of the handset . « show less
i do n't have any of that issue with mine . i have the base set close to my router an several others close to a few of my other pc , s an had no instances of losing internet.im using comcast for my ip .
i live on a single acre and have never hit a dead zone .
yes ...
the main base is wall mountable .
yes , it is called silent mode , it allows y'all to select a period of time during which the handset and or base unit will not ring for outside calls . y'all select the silent mode on , then the hour and minute for off and then for on . i have not used the feature , though the instructions seem to be straight forward in the manual pages 44 and 45..hth
yes , this system will allow you to talk on a landline and have a cellular phone active through bluetooth .
i think so but i 'll probably surface wash by hand so the magnets do n't clunk in my washer .
i have both blue and green shades in my room . when you are standing directly under one , you can tell . however , the combination has not been bothersome at all . i swear to you the filtering of the florescent has made my students so much calmer . i ca n't tell you how often someone walks in my room and says `` it feels so calm in here. ``

2 keys
the slot is 1 2 inch wide and 9 inches long . the slot is also on an angle of 45 degrees , effectivly making the slot about 1 4 inch wide from a verticle line , never the less it is able to handle documents up to 3 8 inch with ease .
no , it mounts to the wall .
it comes with two keys and you can order keys easily from company . just give them model number of the key and they will ship them to you right away .
no . it would be possible fish it out . difficult but possible .
the slot is thin enough that it would be difficult would need a tool of some kind . ours is in the control room so it is not an issue .
the slot is 1 2 '' in depth . a single key would fit fine , but a key ring full of them would not .
the box has hardware for installing it on a concrete wall or a wood wall . fortunately , i was able to install it on a cinder block wall . you must open the door of the box in order to install it on the wall so the support screws are securely hidden when the door is locked . it 's very sturdy metal and no one is going to be able to take it off the wall without knocking a hole in the wall ( in my case ) . however , i would n't install it on drywall because drywall is not sturdy enough . i 'm extremely happy with this security box .
it should be compatible . the apple time capsule router specs say you can connect a printer via usb or ethernet . the brother hl3170cdw printer has both of those options .
you should be able to specify in the print options for it to print on 4x6 paper . however , if you use glossy photo paper , it must specify that it is specifically for laser printers . the glossy surface of inkjet paper turns dark as it goes through the fuser of a laser printer . i do not know if matte finish is any better because i ca n't speak from personal experience on matte photo paper , only the glossy . i use the hp glossy brochure 40lb paper for laserjet printers . you would have to cut it to size as it comes in a 150 pack of 8 1 2 '' x 11 '' . it 's not quite as thick as other photo paper but it has been sufficient for my photo needs . you should be able to specify in the print options for it to print on 4x6 paper . however , if you use glossy photo paper , it must specify that it is specifically for laser printers . the glossy surface of inkjet paper turns dark as it goes through the fuser of a laser printer . i do not know if matte finish is any better because i ca n't speak from personal experience on matte photo paper , only the glossy . i use the hp glossy brochure 40lb paper for laserjet printers . you would have to cut it to size as it comes in a 150 pack of 8 1 2 '' x 11 '' . it 's not quite as thick as other photo ... » read more you should be able to specify in the print options for it to print on 4x6 paper . however , if you use glossy photo paper , it must specify that it is specifically for laser printers . the glossy surface of inkjet paper turns dark as it goes through the fuser of a laser printer . i do not know if matte finish is any better because i ca n't speak from personal experience on matte photo paper , only the glossy . i use the hp glossy brochure 40lb paper for laserjet printers . you would have to cut it to size as it comes in a 150 pack of 8 1 2 '' x 11 '' . it 's not quite as thick as other photo paper but it has been sufficient for my photo needs . « show less
when you select `` print '' from the file menu of whatever application you 're printing your document from , you have the option to select whether or not you want double-sided printing . it does n't print double-sided by default -- you have to check that box .
the answer is yes . the toner cartridge ( each color ) fits in the bracket that holds the drum . the toner cartridge is what you will need to replace most often . when the drum needs to be changed you will have a notification on the screen of the printer .
printer came with a pamphlet titled `` user settings on color mono '' that clearly describes how to print black only and what scenarios cause the printer to print using the color toner . it will print black if set to mono , even if a color toner is out .

yes , black & white , grayscale and color . single & duplex .
my husband and i recently purchased this printer . i used a very heavy bond card stock . at first i tried running it through the manual feed and it worked but not great since it is a 1 page manual feed . my husband suggested i try it in the regular paper tray and it worked great .

great but u have to call brother to help u set it up bc it is amazingly difficult . dont try to set it up alone . they can connect w your computer and do it for you and its complicated but takes them 15 min . thats the only glitch . i tried for abt 2 hrs then i called them , there was no way i couldve figured out the setup alone . and im not a technical idiot either . trust me it was difficult .
no it does n't - the key is just fru-fru .
no it was advertised as one single journal . i believe the photo is means to show the different color options .
the pages are blank . they 're pretty , though . the edges are gold accented which add to its `` antique '' feel .
cream .
no but its easy to write in it . best journal ever ! i used as a journal gor a trip so was easy to place pics
i do n't believe so . although you can write on fabric with these pens , they do n't erase from fabric easily ( i just tried it on the underside of a garment . the eraser is one that works perfectly on paper , as long as it does n't get smudged by pencil . if it does , just clean it by rubbing on clean paper .
not that i 'm aware of , but the ink runs out far , far faster than the eraser , and it 's not even really cost effective to replace the ink . i ended up buying new pens to save money . which feels like a huge waste . anyway , the erasers are super durable and do n't get used up very fast , unlike pencil erasers . you wo n't have a problem even if you buy replacement ink cartridges many times . i think that i erase far more than the average student .
not sure what exactly you mean by 'bright ' . they each write the same color color as the finger grip . the only one that does n't write very dark is the light green , but that goes along with the grip color . these are .5 so the line is thinner . if you are looking for a broader stroke , pick the .7 version . i 've purchased all types from .38 to the ones like a sharpie fine point . also have two color sets of highlighters . these are the best erasing pens i 've ever had . i 'll upload a writing sample photo . in addition to the color and stroke , you will be able to see how well they erase . all samples said 'testing ' before i erased the 'ing ' . not sure what exactly you mean by 'bright ' . they each write the same color color as the finger grip . the only one that does n't write very dark is the light green , but that goes along with the grip color . these are .5 so the line is thinner . if you are looking for a broader stroke , pick the .7 version . i 've purchased all types from .38 to the ones like a sharpie fine point . also have two color sets of highlighters . these are the best erasing pens i 've ever had . i 'll upload a writing sample photo . in addition to the color and stroke , you will be able to see how well they erase . all samples ... » read more not sure what exactly you mean by 'bright ' . they each write the same color color as the finger grip . the only one that does n't write very dark is the light green , but that goes along with the grip color . these are .5 so the line is thinner . if you are looking for a broader stroke , pick the .7 version . i 've purchased all types from .38 to the ones like a sharpie fine point . also have two color sets of highlighters . these are the best erasing pens i 've ever had . i 'll upload a writing sample photo . in addition to the color and stroke , you will be able to see how well they erase . all samples said 'testing ' before i erased the 'ing ' . « show less
yes they are . really like them a lot.like the erasable and clickable .
not really . i have the 0.5 , they write in a thin line so it does n't stand out boldly . like the pens though .
yes . mine , the pen color is the ink color . the inks do run out pretty fast , but they erase extremely well .
i want the 2013 planner for the rest of this year . but instead i got the 2014 .
this is sk48 , and it does have `` plastic pockets . '' so it sounds like it would be the right one .
not sure about the 2015 version ? but the 2014 version says ... mead products llc sidney new york . hope this helps . have not received the 2015 version yet .
no
it 's about 3 feet long
21.8 '' x 3.2 '' x 8.3 '' ; 4.5lbs . very streamline design .
rectangular . http : www.amazon.com gp aw d b009yqoo8u ? cache=47fbf8ddb789d9f7256627ab2c2ccdc0π=sx200_ql40 &qid; =1411591408 &sr; =8-3 # ref=mp_s_a_1_3
the usb 2.0 connection works with any device .
yes
i have piled a few books on top , so i 'd guess 5-10 lbs . remember , anything higher than 3 '' will cover bottom of monitor screen .
3 inches
i extended the time till sleep . also a firmware update had a huge positive impact .
chris , what operating system are you using , how are you connected between computer and the printer ?
yes . i am using with 10.7 , 10.8 , 10.9 and ios devices
comes with a one year advanced exchange warranty , which i think means that if it does n't work , they will replace it with a factory refubished one that will also be warrantied .
i tried to research this . in the specs it lists , `` 110 volt models '' , and `` 220volt models '' so perhaps there is a different configuration they sell . mine is certainly 110 volt .
( 1 ) no it only has 1 drawer for paper . it is the lowest one . just above the drawer is a door that opens to allow single ( manual ) feed printing such as cards , envelopes , etc . ( 2 ) it seems pretty easy to set up although i did n't personally do it . the it guy did it quickly and he was the guy who recommended it . you can always find fault with anything , ours seems to do pretty good compared to the brothers we had ( quite a few problems ) . hope this helps .
it 's a christmas present for my granddaughter . i will take a look and get back to you
hi bob , my photo cube is working properly . i did not touch the cartridges at all , never wound them . i just put them in . it does take a while to print a picture but it 's nice having the ability to print at home .
i returned it as soon as i received it due to poor quality .
yes ! it does work with the 5c . i bought for my husband who has a 4 but my i have a 5c and it works . you do n't need and adaptor . you just plug your usb from your phone charger into the cube on a side slot on the cube . you can also do that with digital cameras and other phones . i love it . the quality of photos are not as good as pros but they are still good and you can do them at at at any time . hope this helps !
the ink is in the paper cartridge . it 's like a thermal paper and everything is included in the package . there is no other ink to buy . works great by the way . we use it at our halloween parties for the kids in our community to take their pictures in their costumes . they love seeing the paper go back and forth in the machine adding each color until the picture is complete . they then can take it home right away .
this dye-sub printer must use the acs-ip-p20-vp paper ribbon kit .
you may have to remove the cartridge ant take off any protective film etc . there is an instruction manual . however , you may also have got a used cartridge from your seller . you may want to search online for the product support telephone number and they may better assist you .
the keyboard is not in its own leathers sleeve , it is magnetic and very easy removable . i highly recommend this leather case !
there is not a hand strap on the back .
to my knowledge , it 's not possible . however , i did read somewhere that each charge is good for 40 to 50 hours of operation , so after about 15 to 20 hours of operation , i simply charge it back up toward assuring that i 'm never surprised . as you 're probably aware , the charging light goes off when the kb is fully charged . hope this helps .
yes
i do n't believe so .
yes
only works with landline
yes , it is u.s. compatible . it is dect 6.0 ; i do not know about 6.0 plus .
to transfer the call to another handset , i know you can simply press the green answer call button on the second handset and then hang up the first handset . i do it all the time . if you do n't have access to the second handset , i do n't think you can `` page '' it during a call . at least it is n't mentioned in the manual .
it does allow for caller id but i 'm not sure if you mean a verbal announcement . if so , i am unsure if there are capabilities within the phone for that . in call caller id is also present .
yes it is .
no , it will come to your door in a big cardboard box , ready to use . hope this helped ... ... ...
there is a key hole in the middle drawer , and when you use the key to lock it , it flips up a lever that stops the middle and top drawer from opening , but there is no way to lock the bottom drawer .
you do not need the hanger for the files with this drawer . the sides of each draw has a lip that holds the file . comes ready to go !
about 25lbs
yes , letter size hanging folders .
i would think so ! especially if the drawers on bottom are empty . : )
no need to install any app .
no , it 's not compatible with the square .
i do n't actually know off hand but if you can bear with me until tuesday i will let u know . i think it will work fine however .
yes
you can get instruction over here http : www.teemistore.com down html ? 7.html
no
no .
it comes with 2
yes
it did not come with any cord . it requires a 6 pin telephone line .
yes it does . its super smooth .
yes it 's mountable . you would need to get the mounting wares from a hardware store though because it does not come with any . i was able to get mine done with stuff from home depot .
yes . shouldnt be a problem but every setuo is different . only had a problem on windows 8 with the software i used but could have been the application and not the physical printer
it does not have an automatic cutter . perforated labels are manually tore off after printing .
you can print jewelry tags but the image area on these is small . the printer is 203 dpi and the resolution of the images would depend on the file size . normally jewelry stores are using a thermal transfer option of the printer and the higher resolution option 300 dpi . that model is the gx430t . that would be our suggestion , but the 420d may also work , just not as well with the images .
ive done over 2000 but these are made to run all day and night . the limitation is really how fast you can swap out rolls or fanfold labels . the heat element can run for about 100,000 4x6 labels at 20 % coverage which is typical for shipping labels . zebra is more expensive but if you are shipping in real quantity its worth the extra .
this printer is direct thermal and does not use ribbons .
no , this model does not include the ethernet port . it comes with serial , parallel and usb ports .
yes it does work with endicia 's dazzle software .

no , a stand is not necessary . it will work on a table or desktop .
i did not order an add-on to this printer and i am able to print wirelessly from my iphone .
yes it will
yes . the only drawback to this is that if you have it scan to pdf , it does n't make it text-searchable . you can manually do that though . we use it to scan to network folders for each user .
this scanner connects to the pc by usb or bluetooth . if you are looking to transfer to iphone - it needs an app to my knowledge does not exist . i recommend this scanner for its convenience . one way to scan to iphone is to take photo of the document and then download the app to transfer image to pdf .
yes . there is a pop up window that asks if you want to continue scanning .
i 'm not sure , do n't know anything about that tablet . if your tablet recognizes other wireless devices i would assume that it would pick it up .
yes you can scan notes in pencil .
yes it does .
yes , very easily
yes
you can adjust it but not on the fly . i have mine slight tilted up because i 'm tall whereas my coworker has it flat . adjustments take finagling .
no , but i have n't needed it with the standing desk .
hi - we 're making a new monitor stand that will safely support heavier monitors & all-in-one 's ( like the imac ) . this stand has room for 2 monitors ( i 'm testing a prototype now w two 19 '' monitors ) . contact us through our website if you 'd like to be notified when we release this brand new product . in case you do n't want to wait , you can order 2 monitor stands and use them simultaneously to support 2 monitors while standing ( so you will have 2 monitor stands + 1 keyboard tray ) .
that wont be necessary , once you have accomplished the appropriate angles to create a sturdy stance nothing is going to fall.i stand all day but on occasion i sit . i simple bring my keyboard down to my desk and move my monitor to the keyboard tray which is perfect eye level for me i am 5'7 .
its fairly simple the angles are changed with a button the size of your thumb not too much pressure is needed to press it down . i think maybe 2-3 buttons were a little hard , as long as you make sure your angles fall on the line ( they are measure like a compass ) than you wont have to much trouble . : )
no it is not wide enough or stable enough
i use a samsung 28 inch monitor that is close to this weight if not heavier and it works great . this is a solid product . if you are using this to help with any back or neck issues you will be very happy ... .
simple answer : no.more complicated answer : yes , but only if the android or ios device will work with a -wired- usb keyboard . the reason for this is that barcode scanners like this work basically like a keyboard . if you open a text editor and then scan something , it behaves as though you keyed the the barcode in and hit return . this device does not have any bluetooth capability and you must use the 2.4ghz wireless usb dongle .
if you 're running windows 7 it should load the driver . i do n't remember any software coming with it . i simply plugged in the bluetooth receiver and windows did the rest . be sure to follow the instructions which are a bit difficult to read as the interpreter may not have had a firm grasp on the english language . the scanner will scan strait into an excel spread sheet however .
yes . it works great for me
yes it will work with both . been using mine with windows 8.1 and excel with out a problem
no . it charges via a standard usb cable .
i have not used it that way , but from the literature it looks like it will do that .
yes , that 's what i use most often .
i think that it was as easy to do as any simple printer which this hp deskjet is . i only had to put in the cartridges when i bought it and i have not run out of ink yet . like anything , i think that it is important for us to believe that we can do something . believe that you can do it and do it after a good night 's sleep ... ..
this printer doesnt have a wireless function
there is only 1 size hp 61 ... . but if your asking what off brands there may be ? there are many just google what ink cartridges are compatible with hp 61 and you will see plenty show up .
we use windows 7 , so i do n't know about windows 8 , but ... ours is not wireless . however , we access it wirelessly through our home network . we simply access the computer it is connected to and do it that way . it could also be set up through a bluetooth access to the computer that the printer is attached to .
you need to have a degree in computer science and in printer hardware to get this printer to work non-wirelessly let along wirelessly . the 2514 printer is anything but idiotproof .
i do n't know .
i am having great results with these cartridges . i took the innobella 's that came with my mfc-j285dw out and installed these and my printer is running great . ca n't wait until i need some more . warning , because these are the high yield cartridges , i will be waiting a while because they last . i installed mine two months ago and it has n't use hardly anything . great buy for the money .
moti - i 've had a firmware problem with a new brother mfc-j450dw i bought at the end of 2014. i 've tried third party inks without success - the printer does n't recognize them .
no
i have never had a a problem with compatability . did u remove the tape ? i would try reinstalling . if nothing works contact speedy inks .
yes i have used them with that printer
yes they do !
it does not .
depends on how large your bag is , printer is 17 '' x 10 '' x 5 '' . canon also makes some portable printers like the ip100 and the selphy line .
yes but i only printed about 10 sheets over the course of 2 months and it 's broken already ,
it is not . airprint is available on only higher-end canon color printers .
tom , yes it does . i bought this printer a few weeks ago . no usb cable though !
i have refilled the black cartridge several times .
yes
i would agree that at it 's best it can spit out 20 pages a minute like the page description says , but i mostly do printing myself that involves a little more saturation and it takes longer and those take longer .
yes it does .
no there are n't ; only a usb port
i have them boththe 4640 has the extra paper capacity.i use it in my main officethe 4630 is at my vacation home.both really great printers.i recommend themdavid
yes , i agree with the previous answer . it seems to be paper only . i have n't found any info on it printing directly on a cd or dvd . ( unless there is some kind of 3rd party adapter or modification , but i do n't know of any ) . and this probably would void the epson warranty .
